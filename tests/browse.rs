//! The browse family over gonk's ONE dataset: what it serves, where its quads land, what
//! the shared handle costs, and what the watcher buys.
//!
//! Five things are gonk's to get wrong here, and each is a test:
//!
//! - [`the_served_catalog_is_exactly_what_this_manifest_links`] — linking two more crates put
//!   twenty more resources behind the doors; the catalog is pinned id by id, as it was.
//! - [`a_browse_write_touches_no_reserved_graph`] — the PROMISE `main` makes to
//!   `ikigai-store`, checked at the boundary with the store's own tripwire rather than
//!   trusted in a comment.
//! - [`a_browse_read_touches_no_reserved_graph`] — the same tripwire around a READ, which is
//!   the reason the manifest takes `ikigai-browse` 0.4.0: before it, a read could relocate
//!   another writer's quads (ledger #265).
//! - [`a_named_graph_choice_moves_the_promise_with_it`] — the graph this server CHOSE, walked
//!   end to end: browse's quads land in it, none in the default graph, and the promise moved
//!   with the choice rather than beside it (ledger #282).
//! - [`the_browse_graphs_scoped_reads_are_not_cached_and_the_ledgers_still_are`] — obligation
//!   3 of the graph decision, asked of the kernel rather than of the promise.
//! - [`a_bare_pattern_select_sees_nothing_because_every_quad_is_in_a_named_graph`] — the
//!   other half of that: where the quads land is a fact about the data, and what an UNSCOPED
//!   query sees is a fact about the dataset. A `0` from the broad door is the default graph,
//!   not an empty store, and the README's import-verification table rests on it.
//! - [`a_scoped_token_reads_browse_and_both_tokens_run_the_join`] — obligation 2: what
//!   `urn:cap:store:read:graph:<browse graph>` buys, the boundary it does not cross, and the
//!   ledger↔browse join below root that `ikigai-store` 0.2.5 made expressible.
//! - [`the_join_runs_through_the_http_door_under_a_signed_in_grant`] — the same join asked
//!   for the way a caller outside this process asks: over loopback HTTP, under a passkey
//!   identity's grant.
//! - [`a_ledger_item_joins_an_annotation_on_a_repo_file`] — the point of one dataset, with
//!   both halves naming their graph (obligation 4).
//! - [`the_shared_handle_costs_the_ledger_nothing`] — the naive composition beside the one
//!   this server builds, and the default-graph composition beside the named one, with the
//!   read timings printed.
//! - [`a_watched_file_read_recomputes_after_the_file_changes_on_disk`] — the cache that
//!   watcher makes safe, driven through the watcher's own notification path.
//!
//! Every store here is an `in_memory_*` one, which carries the SAME coverage as its durable
//! twin — `in_memory_shared_declaring` for the composition this server builds, plain
//! `in_memory_shared` for the naive one it refused — and takes no RocksDB lock, so these run
//! beside a live gonk holding `~/.ikigai/store`.

/// ★ The PROMISE `main` makes when it hands the handle out — the [`browse::Graph`] choice
/// read as `SharerWrites` — pinned at the boundary with `ikigai-store`'s own tripwire.
/// Every quad `ikigai-browse` writes goes into the graph this server chose (and, before
/// 2026-09-16, into the default one), so no graph this store RESERVES from the sharer can
/// move when browse writes; and a graph that cannot move is a graph whose scoped reads stay
/// cacheable, which is every read the ledger makes.
///
/// ★ Since the graph decision the promise names one graph, so the browse graph is not among
/// the reserved ones and the ledger's still is — the assertion on `before.len()` below is
/// that sentence, and it would have been 2 with the promise left at the bare default.
///
/// ⚠ **The fingerprint is over QUADS, not over the set of graph names**, and that is the
/// difference that matters: this server wrote the name-set version by hand until
/// `ikigai-store` 0.2.4, and it would have missed a sharer writing into a named graph that
/// already existed — which is exactly the case a running gonk is in, where the ledger's graph
/// is always there. It also *errors* on a store that declared nothing, rather than passing
/// vacuously.
///
/// ⚠ Both fingerprints are taken around the SHARER's write and nothing else. A write through
/// `ikigai-store`'s own endpoints changes a reserved graph legitimately — it cut a thread when
/// it did — and would read here as a broken promise.
///
/// The day browse writes a graph the promise does not name, this test is red HERE, where the
/// promise is made, instead of silently stale in the cache of a running server.
