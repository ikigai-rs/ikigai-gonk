# ikigai-gonk

**A standalone work-ledger server for [ikigai](https://github.com/ikigai-rs).** One binary
holds the machine's durable RDF store and serves named ledgers — items, comments, labels,
links, claims, and a ranked `next` — through three doors: HTTP on loopback port 1060, with a
browser face for reading, filing, editing, closing, deleting and querying; an owner-only Unix
socket; and QUIC for other machines, where every connection is admitted by a client
certificate and runs under the grant that certificate is enrolled for.

$ ikigai-gonk
ikigai-gonk 0.1.0 — holding the store at /Users/you/.ikigai/store
  http    http://localhost:1060/ — loopback (127.0.0.1:1060); anonymous read+write: default; 0 passkey(s)

```

## Install and run

From a clone:

```sh
cargo install --locked --path .
ikigai-gonk
```

That is the whole setup. The dataset lives in `~/.ikigai/store`, the socket at
`~/.ikigai/gonk.sock`, and HTTP on `127.0.0.1:1060`. No configuration file is needed, and no
certificate is needed until another machine has to reach it.

`ikigai-gonk --help` prints every flag and file.

## In a browser

Open **<http://localhost:1060/>** — `localhost`, not `127.0.0.1`: a passkey is bound to a
name, and a browser refuses an IP address as one.

- **Browse.** The front page is the first ledger you may read, open items first, with filters
  for closed and all and a title search. Each item has its own page: body, filing metadata,
  labels, links, `about` targets and comments.
- **A listing renders fifty rows and says so.** The line above the list is the count the
  filter matched, not the count the page drew — "showing the 50 most recently updated of 411
  open items", with a link for the rest. `?limit=<n>` or `?limit=all` asks for more, up to
  500 in one render. ⚠ The bound is latency, and the number is measured: the server-side
  XSLT costs about 6 ms per row at fifty rows and about 16 ms at four hundred, so a page of
  410 items cost **6.5 seconds** — slow enough to read as a hung server rather than a slow
  page. Reading the ledger is not the expensive part (0.09 s for the whole set), which is why
  the page still counts everything and bounds only what it draws.
  `cargo run --release --example render-cost -- <items.ttl> [rows|all]` takes the numbers again.
- **File, edit, work.** A form on the ledger page files an item (first line the title, a blank
  line, then the body). An item page comments, edits the title, body and priority, closes with
  a reason or reopens, claims or releases, defers or resumes, labels and links.
- **Delete and purge are two acts.** *Delete* moves the item into the ledger's graveyard graph
  and leaves a tombstone; it is recoverable by hand. *Purge* destroys the content in both
  graphs and leaves only the tombstone. They are separate sections with separate
  confirmations, and each appears only for a caller whose grant holds it.
- **Query.** <http://localhost:1060/sparql> runs SELECT, ASK, CONSTRUCT and DESCRIBE over one
  ledger's graph and renders the answer as a table (or Turtle, or a boolean). Nine sample
  queries sit above the editor — one named ledger (with an explicit `GRAPH` clause, because
  each ledger is its own graph), open by priority, p1 only, a `COUNT` by `repo:` label,
  security, recently updated, items with comments, closed with their reasons, and a body-text
  search to edit. A sample fills the box and runs nothing: you press Run. A `ledger:` IRI
  reads as a CURIE (`ledger:open`, not `…/ledger#open`), with the prefix bound once above the
  table; the same URL answers a machine in the store's own formats, raw IRIs and all: `curl -H
  'Accept: application/sparql-results+json' 'http://127.0.0.1:1060/sparql?query=…'`.
  ⚠ There is deliberately **no "oldest" sample**: `dcterms:created` is when an item was
  *filed*, and a bulk migration files hundreds in one minute, so it does not say how long the
  work has waited. The page says so next to the buttons.
- **A result set is somewhere to go next, not a wall of text.** An item IRI or an item number
  in a result becomes a link to that item; a `repo:` label becomes a link that asks the ledger
  a *new* question — the open items with that label — so an item the first query never
  returned still appears. What becomes a control is decided by
  [a rule table that is itself a resource](#the-render-rules-are-a-resource), not by a list of
  blessed column names.

The face is hypermedia: server-rendered HTML with [htmx](https://htmx.org) for the in-place
updates, no single-page app and no build step. Every page is a **transform of a graph face** —
a ledger page is `urn:iki:ledger:{ledger}:items as=text/turtle`, re-serialized as RDF/XML and
rendered by one XSLT stylesheet whose templates match on `rdf:type`, server-side through
`ikigai-xslt`. It works at phone width, follows the system's light or dark scheme, and its
palette is held to the WCAG AA contrast floor in both by a test.

### Passkeys: who you are, and what that grants

An anonymous caller on this machine can read and write the ledgers in `gonk.http.ledger` —
exactly what the HTTP door granted before it had a face. Anything more, such as delete, purge
or another ledger, belongs to an identity:

```sh
ikigai-gonk passkey invite brian --ledger default=delete
```

```text
passkey invite for `brian` — grant `brian` (6 scopes) in /Users/you/.config/ikigai/gonk/grants.json
  valid for 30 minutes, once
  open  http://localhost:1060/#invite=…
```

What you will see:

1. **Open the link** in a browser on this machine. A panel, *Create a passkey for this
   server*, asks for a label (say `laptop Touch ID`).
2. **Create passkey.** The browser's own passkey sheet appears: Touch ID, a security key, or a
   phone. Approve it. The server enrols the credential's public key under the grant `brian`,
   the panel closes, and the page says *Passkey created for … (grant brian). Now click Sign in
   with passkey to use it.*
3. **Sign in with passkey**, in the header, and approve the sheet a second time. The page
   reloads showing *Signed in as … (grant brian)*, and that browser holds the grant until it
   signs out, the session's 12 hours end, or the server restarts.

The second click is deliberate. When the creation sheet closes it still holds the window's
focus, and a browser refuses a sign-in prompt from a page without focus, so gonk waits for
the click rather than chaining the two. If a sheet is cancelled or times out, the page says so
and names the button to click again. A creation that did not finish leaves the invite unused,
good until it expires.

- **One grant table for both identity doors.** A passkey is an identity the way a client
  certificate is. Both map to a grant name in `gonk/clients.json` (certificates under
  `clients`, passkeys under `passkeys`), and the grant name maps to scopes in
  `gonk/grants.json`, the one file where scope lists live. Enrol a laptop certificate and a
  passkey under the same name and they hold the same authority, and editing the grant changes
  both on the next request or connection. Delete a passkey's entry from `clients.json` to
  revoke it, with no restart.
- **An identity is strictly stronger than anonymous.** A signed-in caller holds the anonymous
  grant plus its own, and `passkey invite` refuses a grant that adds nothing.
- **The invite is the registration's trust anchor.** No attestation is parsed. The question
  that matters is whether this person was invited, and a single-use, expiring code answers it.
  The server stores only the code's SHA-256.
- **Verification** is `ikigai-passkey`'s: ES256, the exact origin `http://localhost:<port>`,
  RP ID `localhost`, a single-use challenge, user verification required, and a signature
  counter that must not go backwards.
- ⚠ **The session cookie is set by the page's script, so it is not `HttpOnly`.** The HTTP
  transport builds every response from a resource representation and cannot add `Set-Cookie`.
  What remains is `SameSite=Strict`, a same-origin Content-Security-Policy with no inline
  script, and a session table that lives in memory.

### What the HTTP door refuses a browser

A door that grants writes to whatever reaches loopback also grants them to any web page open
on the machine: a page on any site can `POST` a form to `http://127.0.0.1:1060/` without a
preflight. So the capability is computed per request, and two browser-only signals take it
away:

- a write whose `Origin` or `Sec-Fetch-Site` names another site gets **nothing** (403). A local
  process such as `curl` or a script sends neither header, so it is unaffected;
- a request whose `Host` is not `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]` gets **nothing**, reads
  included. That is the DNS-rebinding defence.

### SPARQL, confined by construction

`/sparql` never touches the store's whole-dataset doors. A query runs at
`urn:iki:store:graph-{select,ask,construct,describe}` with `graph=` set to the chosen
ledger's graph and **the caller's** capability. The store sets that graph as the query's entire
dataset before evaluation, so there is nothing else to see, and a grant naming one ledger
cannot read another. `FROM` and `FROM NAMED` are refused rather than silently overridden; the
page says so. It is read-only: an update is not a query form it runs.

⚠ The confinement to ONE graph is **this page's**, not the endpoint's. Since `ikigai-store`
0.2.5 a scoped read takes a whitespace-separated SET of graphs, so a caller holding a read
token for each can join across them — a ledger and the browse graph, say — by calling
`urn:iki:store:graph-select` directly; `FROM` stays refused over a set as much as over one
graph, and `GRAPH <g>` for a `g` outside the issued set matches nothing rather than erroring.
This page has no graph selector yet, so it shows that join as an example and does not offer to
run it (`web::CROSS_GRAPH`).

### Routes

| path | resource | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | `urn:iki:gonk:page:home` | the first readable ledger |
| `/l/{ledger}` · `/l/{ledger}/items` | `urn:iki:gonk:page:ledger:{ledger}` · `…:fragment:items:{ledger}` | a ledger, page and fragment |
| `/l/{ledger}/item/{id}` · `…/card` | `urn:iki:gonk:page:item:{ledger}:{id}` · `…:fragment:item:…` | one item |
| `POST /act` | `urn:iki:gonk:act` | a form, as one ledger action |
| `/sparql` · `/sparql/results` | `urn:iki:gonk:sparql` · `…:fragment:sparql` | query |
| `POST /auth/{op}` | `urn:iki:gonk:passkey:{op}` | passkey ceremonies and sessions |
| `/render-rules` | `urn:iki:gonk:render-rules` | which result cells become controls, as Turtle |
| `/static/{name}` | `urn:iki:gonk:asset:{name}` | `gonk.css`, `gonk.js`, `htmx.min.js` |
| `/browse` | `urn:iki:gonk:page:browse` | the repositories this grant may read |
| `/browse/{iri}` | `urn:iki:gonk:page:browse:{iri}` | the page a browse face renders inside |
| `/k?c={command}` | `urn:iki:gonk:k` | the adapter those faces call — one read, or one annotation |
| `/queue` · `/queue/rows` | `urn:iki:gonk:page:queue` · `…:fragment:queue` | the review queue, and the section it swaps |
| `POST /queue/decide` | `urn:iki:gonk:queue:decide` | one human decision on one finding |

These exist **only on the HTTP door**. The socket and QUIC doors serve exactly the store and
the ledger, as before, and `tests/conformance.rs` pins both catalogs.

**Every form issues an action the ledger already declares.** `/act` builds the target from
`ikigai-ledger`'s own naming (`urn:iki:ledger:{ledger}:{action}`, or `…:item:{id}`), refuses a
verb the target does not describe, and refuses any field that the verb's contract does not
name. It runs under the caller's capability, so the ledger's checks decide.

### Browsing a repository at this port

```sh
open http://127.0.0.1:1060/browse                             # the roots this grant may read
open http://127.0.0.1:1060/browse/urn:repo:ikigai-core:tree   # straight into one
```

**The header carries a `Browse` link** whenever the caller may read at least one configured
root, next to the ledgers and `SPARQL`, and it lands on `/browse` — the list. One link rather
than one per root: seven repository names in a header stop being a header, and there is no
natural first root for a single link to point at. Both the link and the list are built from
the roots the caller may READ (`ikigai-browse`'s own two checks: a grant naming the root, or
the all-roots wildcard), so a caller is never offered a door that answers it a 403, and a
caller who may read nothing sees no link at all.

The page is a gonk page — same header, same sign-in control — with one region that loads
`ikigai-browse`'s own HTML face into it. **Everything after that first paint is the face's
markup and the face's affordances**: crumbs, directory entries, file views, the annotate
form, Explain and Explain With, and whatever a later `ikigai-browse` adds. gonk renders none
of it and knows about none of it; it supplies the door and the identity.

Those affordances are written `hx-get="/k/source {iri} [k=v …]"` and
`hx-post="/k/sink urn:iki:annotation"` — a command, in the path. ⚠ **This door cannot parse
that back into a resource**: it is the `ikigai-web` library, which percent-decodes the path
and then rebuilds a target IRI from it, and a command has spaces in it, which no IRI may. So
the command travels as one query value here —

```sh
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:1060/k?c=source%20urn:repo:ikigai-core:file:README.md%20as=text/html'
```

— and `web/gonk.js` folds the path spelling into that query form in the browser, on
`htmx:configRequest`, in one line that knows about commands and nothing about buttons. (The
standalone `ikigai-web` server parses the raw request-target itself, which is why the same
affordances work there untouched.)

**What a browser may do here is entirely its grant.** `/k` runs every request under the
per-request capability above — so a cross-site `POST` mints nothing, a rebound `Host` reads
nothing, and the anonymous loopback caller, which holds ledger tokens only, cannot read a
repository at all, let alone spend inference on explaining one. A signed-in identity can do
exactly what its grant names, and browsing needs four tokens beyond a ledger's:

```text
urn:cap:browse:read:*     read the repository at all (the wildcard browse declares)
urn:cap:annotate          mint annotations — the human ones and a review's findings
urn:cap:net:localhost     reach the mounted model, which is what deriving costs authority for
urn:cap:store:{read,write}:graph:urn:iki:browse:graph:default    the archive those land in
```

⚠ **Only the last pair can be minted by this binary** (`passkey invite … --browse-graph
write`). The first three have no flag: `passkey invite` and `client add` mint per-ledger
grants and the browse graph's store doors, and nothing else — so a browsing identity is made
today by adding those names to its entry in `~/.config/ikigai/gonk/grants.json` by hand. That
is not a hole in the boundary: the file is re-read on every request and checked fail-closed
each time, so the store's whole-dataset tokens and the `urn:cap:net:*` / `urn:cap:exec:*`
offering wildcards are refused whether they were written by this binary or by an editor —
but that the tooling cannot express a grant an operator is expected to hold is a real gap
(ledger #435).

⚠ **A click on Explain spends inference, and nothing here counts it.** The per-face token
ceilings (`gonk.explain.*.max_tokens`) bound ONE call. A directory-grain explanation fans out
per child inside `ikigai-browse` — each child's own explanation, recursively, with unchanged
children as archive hits — so one click on a large directory is many model calls, and the
door cannot see that from outside. `/k` issues exactly one kernel request per HTTP request
and prefetches nothing; the rest is the resource's economics, not the door's.

### The review Queue: a human publishes, or nothing does

```sh
open http://127.0.0.1:1060/queue                      # what is pending, in triage order
open 'http://127.0.0.1:1060/queue?state=published'    # what was published, and who rated it what
```

Since `ikigai-browse` 0.5.0 a review pass no longer mints annotations. It produces **pending
findings** at `urn:iki:finding:{id}`, and `Sink urn:iki:finding:{id} decision=publish` — gated
by `urn:cap:annotate` — is the only path into the `urn:iki:annotation:` family. Brian's rule,
2026-09-19: *"Nothing gets published to Gonk except by the human."* This page is the face for
that act, and the interlock it creates is the reason the git-event trigger above can land
complete and deliberately unable to publish anything.

⚠ **A queue is not a gate.** Nothing in it blocks a commit, a push or a merge. The word reads
like a gate to anyone who has used one, so the page says so in as many words.

**The header carries a `Queue` link** only when the caller may read at least one root **and**
holds `urn:cap:annotate` — a link to a page of things you cannot decide is worse than no link.
For the same reason the decision form is drawn only for a caller who could submit it: an offer
you refuse teaches people to ignore refusals. An **anonymous loopback caller can do nothing to
a finding in either direction** — it cannot read the queue (that needs `urn:cap:browse:read:*`)
and cannot publish one (that needs `urn:cap:annotate` as well), and
`tests/queue.rs::an_anonymous_loopback_caller_can_neither_read_nor_decide_a_finding` measures
both rather than asserting the reasoning.

★ **The severity menu, the decision buttons and the state nav are rendered from the
CONTRACT** — `Meta urn:iki:finding:{id}` and `Meta urn:repo:{repo}:findings`, read through the
kernel — never from a list in this crate. `ikigai-browse` deliberately serves one constant to
the Sink's `one_of`, to the review prompt and to its own menu so the three cannot drift; a
fourth copy here would be the one that went stale in silence, and the refusal would arrive at
the click. `tests/queue.rs::no_severity_word_is_written_down_in_this_crate` holds the page code
and the stylesheet to it, with the contract as the oracle. ⚠ When a contract cannot be read,
**no form is rendered at all** rather than a fallback menu.

**Both ratings are kept.** The model's proposal rides on the finding; the human's final rating
rides on the decision node. That is what makes *"is this reviewer calibrated?"* a query rather
than an impression, and it is why `published` and `declined` are states on this page rather
than clutter swept off it.

⚠ **A decision is final, and the page says what undoing one would be.** An identical repeat is
a no-op; anything that would change the record is refused naming what is on file. There is
**no Delete on a finding** — declining is how a human removes one, and the decline is the
record. Undoing a *publication* is `delete urn:iki:annotation:{id}`, a separate visible act
under the same capability.

**The intray depth is on this page and nowhere else.** `ikigai-browse` does not expose it and
deliberately did not add it: that number belongs to the trigger above, which lives in this
repo. Without it *"nothing has happened yet"* and *"39 still queued"* render identically, which
is exactly the silent absence this page exists to prevent — so the line has four shapes, and
three of them are not a number: no queue configured, the queue is empty, N waiting, and *the
queue could not be read*.

⚠ **That count is read from the directory, not through the kernel**, and the reason is a gap
worth naming: the depth lives behind `Source urn:space:{name}`, which requires
`urn:cap:space:read`, and this server mints that token for **nobody** — so there is no
capability any page could run under that would be allowed to ask. Either the depth becomes a
resource of gonk's own with its own floor, or the space's read token becomes mintable; until
one of those, the page counts files the way the startup banner already does.

## The render rules are a resource

A SPARQL result set is terminal by default: numbers you read out of the table and type
somewhere else. gonk turns some of its cells into controls — an item links to that item, a
`repo:` label asks the ledger for that repo's open items — and **what becomes a control is
decided by a rule table you can read, diff and replace**, served at `/render-rules` as Turtle:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:1060/render-rules
```

Why a resource rather than a config key, or a list of column names in the binary: **a SPARQL
result set carries whatever variable names its author chose.** A renderer that special-cases a
column called `number` works for the queries shipped with it and fails for the query you write
tomorrow. So the rules match on what a cell IS — its term kind, the shape of its value, a value
prefix — and the table is data about how to read *this deployment's* data, which belongs in the
graph rather than in the code. Drop your own file at `<config home>/gonk/render-rules.ttl` and
gonk serves and obeys that one instead; a table it cannot obey stops the server at startup,
because a rule that silently did nothing would look exactly like one in effect.

| the rule shipped | matches | what the cell becomes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rule:item-iri` | a `urn:iki:ledger:{ledger}:item:{id}` value, under any column | a link to that item |
| `rule:item-number` | a bare integer, under a column named `number`, `item`, `n`, … | a link to that item |
| `rule:repo-label` | a literal starting `repo:` | a link that runs that repo's **open** items |

⚠ **A bare integer is genuinely ambiguous, and that is why one rule reads a column name.**
`SELECT ?number ?title (COUNT(?comment) AS ?comments)` renders `244 … 3`: a result set carries
no provenance, so the renderer cannot see that one integer came from `ledger:number` and the
other from a `COUNT`, and linking every integer would send "3 comments" to item #3. Checking
that item 3 exists does not help — it does. So that rule alone consults the name, its default
covers the obvious spellings, and the list lives in the table where you can extend it.

⚠ **Substitution is escaped for the grammar it lands in, by the renderer, never by the rule.**
Values come out of the store and the store holds text other people wrote. A `render:link`
template percent-encodes every substitution; a `render:query` template escapes it for the
SPARQL string-literal grammar, so a label containing a quote and a closing brace is *content*
and cannot change the shape of the query it runs. A rule author writes `"{value}"` and has no
way to opt out.

The vocabulary is `urn:iki:gonk:render#` and it is deliberately **not** in `ikigai-vocab`: it
says nothing about work, only about how one HTML face renders a result cell. The shipped table
is its own documentation — `web/render-rules.ttl` is a commented file, and it is the file
`/render-rules` serves.

## Filing and reading work over HTTP

Every resource of [`ikigai-ledger`](https://github.com/ikigai-rs/ikigai-ledger) is reachable
by the mechanical mapping `ikigai-web` uses: the path's segments become the IRI, the method
the verb, query parameters the arguments, the body the content, and `Accept` the
representation. `as` and `content` are the transport's own names, so a query parameter
spelled either is ignored.

```sh
curl -X POST --data-binary $'Publish the store\n\nIt needs a README.' http://127.0.0.1:1060/iki/ledger/append
curl http://127.0.0.1:1060/iki/ledger/items
curl http://127.0.0.1:1060/iki/ledger/next
curl -H 'Accept: text/turtle' http://127.0.0.1:1060/iki/ledger/items
curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:1060/iki/ledger/close?item=1'
```

| method | path | resource |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/iki/ledger/append` | `Sink urn:iki:ledger:append` |
| `GET` | `/iki/ledger/items` | `Source urn:iki:ledger:items` |
| `GET` | `/iki/ledger/acme/next` | `Source urn:iki:ledger:acme:next` |
| `DELETE` | `/iki/ledger/item/01m2h…` | needs the delete grant — anonymous callers are refused |

⚠ These resource paths are for programs, not browsers. `ikigai-web` turns the **first** type in
`Accept` into the requested face, and a browser's first type is `text/html`, which the ledger's
own resources do not serve. Opening `/iki/ledger/items` in a browser therefore answers
`400 … text/html is not a face this resource serves`. The pages above are the browser's way in.

A path nothing serves answers `404` with a sentence naming where to start.

## From another ikigai process on this machine

Gonk holds the dataset, so nothing else opens it. Every other ikigai process — the REPL, a
script, an agent — reaches the ledger and the store through gonk's socket. Two lines in
`~/.config/ikigai/config.toml`, because a mount claims one prefix:

```toml
mount = "prefer urn:iki:store:=/Users/you/.ikigai/gonk.sock"
mount = "prefer urn:iki:ledger:=/Users/you/.ikigai/gonk.sock"
```

```sh
ikigai -c 'sink urn:iki:ledger:append Filed from the cli' -c 'source urn:iki:ledger:items'
```

A host that used to open the store itself (`store = true` in that file) drops that line and
takes these two. If both run at once, the second to start is refused by RocksDB with the
path it tried and these two lines.

With browse roots configured, two more prefixes are served here — and they are separate mount
lines for the same reason, plus one spelling that is easy to get wrong:

```toml
mount = "prefer urn:repo:=/Users/you/.ikigai/gonk.sock"
mount = "prefer urn:iki:annotation=/Users/you/.ikigai/gonk.sock"   # ⚠ no trailing colon
```

The annotation line has no trailing colon deliberately: mounts match by plain string prefix,
and `urn:iki:annotation` covers both `urn:iki:annotation:{id}` and the bare
`urn:iki:annotation` that a Sink mints under — the only write path the family has. Written
`urn:iki:annotation:=`, every new annotation fails to route, silently.

⚠ **`urn:repo:` is one prefix over two families.** That mount sends `urn:repo:{root}:file:…`
(browse) *and* `urn:repo:status`, `urn:repo:log`, `urn:repo:pr:list` (the facades) to gonk,
where they run in gonk's process, under gonk's working directory, with whatever capability the
caller carried across. A host that wants the facades local and only the roots remote cannot
say so with a prefix mount. (`urn:system:exec` is outside that prefix and stays wherever the
calling host binds it, unless mounted by name.)

## From another machine, over QUIC

The QUIC door opens once a client **certificate** is enrolled. Passkeys never open it: they
live in the same `clients.json`, but they sign in on the HTTP door only. Setting
`gonk.quic.bind` (or `--quic-bind`) turns "once a certificate is enrolled" into "must open":
with a bind named and no certificate to admit, gonk refuses to start rather than quietly
leaving the door shut. On the gonk machine:

```sh
ikigai-gonk client add laptop --ledger default=write
```

That generates this server's identity on first use, mints a client identity into
`~/.config/ikigai/gonk/quic/clients/laptop/`, and enrols its certificate fingerprint under a
grant called `laptop` holding exactly the tokens for reading and writing the `default`
ledger. Restart `ikigai-gonk` — the set of trusted certificates is read at startup — and the
banner reports `quic  udp 0.0.0.0:1060`.

Copy that directory to the other machine; it holds `client.crt`, `client.key` and the
`server.crt` to pin, laid out as the cli's `--cert-dir` expects. There, with a cli built with
QUIC:

```sh
cargo install --locked ikigai-cli --features quic
ikigai --connect quic://gonk-host:1060 --cert-dir ~/gonk-laptop -c 'source urn:iki:ledger:items'
```

or, to put the ledger into that machine's own ikigai processes:

```toml
mount = "prefer urn:iki:store:=quic://gonk-host:1060 /home/you/gonk-laptop"
mount = "prefer urn:iki:ledger:=quic://gonk-host:1060 /home/you/gonk-laptop"
```

**To keep a client's private key on the client**, let it generate its own identity and
enrol only the certificate: `ikigai cert generate --dir ~/gonk-laptop` there, copy its
`client.crt` here, and `ikigai-gonk client add laptop --cert client.crt --ledger
default=write`; then copy the bundle's `server.crt` back over the one in `~/gonk-laptop`.

What admission means today: a client holding a trusted certificate and an enrolment is
admitted until its entry is removed from `clients.json`, which takes effect on its next
connection. There is no certificate authority, no expiry, no rotation and no automated trust
distribution — the server certificate is pinned by copying it.

`ikigai-gonk grants <ledger> <read|write|delete|purge>` prints the token list for one
ledger, for writing `grants.json` by hand.

## Explaining what it browses

With a browse root configured and a **mounted model**, gonk serves `ikigai-browse`'s
explanation families over the same dataset: an LLM-derived orientation for a file or a
directory, a review pass whose findings are minted as real annotations, and the same two for
a pull request.

```toml
gonk.browse.root = "core=~/git-personal/ikigai-core"
gonk.mount = "prefer urn:llm:=quic://127.0.0.1:4433 ~/.config/ikigai/gonk/quic/peers/plasma"
```

```text
urn:repo:{root}:explain[:{path}]           an orientation, archived
urn:repo:{root}:explain-versions[:{path}]  what the archive holds — derives nothing
urn:repo:{root}:review:{path}              findings as annotations in this dataset
urn:repo:{root}:pr:{n}:explain, :review    the same two over a pull request
```

**The model is mounted, not linked**, and that is the decision this feature turned on. gonk
could have depended on `ikigai-llm` and talked to Ollama itself; then this binary would carry
an outbound HTTP client, on a server whose argument for what it is safe to run is largely an
argument about what is compiled into it. Instead `urn:llm:` resolves on a peer — an
`ikigai serve quic://…` that lends its inference, or an ikigai host on this machine over its
socket — and what gonk gains is one connection to one configured address.

**`prefer`, and what it means for a ledger server.** The cli's `prefer` is an override
wrapped in a failover over the local spaces: the peer when it answers, this machine when it
does not. gonk binds nothing under `urn:llm:`, so there is no local half — and the half that
matters here is the other one: **an absent peer costs explain and nothing else.** gonk does
not dial at startup, a failed dial is held off for thirty seconds rather than retried per
request, and a ledger read never touches the mount. A peer that is down makes a derivation
`Unavailable` — the transient it is — not `Denied` and not `Unresolved`.

**Binding is a property of the config, not of reachability.** With no `gonk.mount` line the
explanation rows are not bound at all, because an action the manifold offers and the kernel
can never satisfy is an over-offer. With one, they are bound whether or not the peer answers
today.

**Which peer to mount.** Either works, and the choice is about topology rather than
protocol. A socket (`prefer urn:llm:=~/.ikigai/host.sock`) needs no certificates and never
touches a network interface, but it couples gonk's model traffic to whatever else that host
serves — on this machine, the personal agent that holds the calendar and contacts grants,
which is the wrong neighbour for a server whose blast radius is the point. A QUIC peer needs
a client certificate the peer has enrolled, and is **the same configuration whether the model
is on this machine or another one**: mounting a bigger machine's inference later changes the
host in one line and nothing else. That is why the line above is the one this README shows.

**Getting the certificate**, which is the same relationship as
[the QUIC door](#from-another-machine-over-quic) with gonk on the other side of it. On the
gonk machine, generate an identity for this mount and hand the peer its public half:

```sh
ikigai cert generate --dir ~/.config/ikigai/gonk/quic/peers/plasma
# on the peer: trust it, then restart the peer (trusted certs are read at startup)
cp ~/.config/ikigai/gonk/quic/peers/plasma/client.crt <peer cert-dir>/clients/gonk.crt
# and back on the gonk machine, pin the peer:
cp <peer cert-dir>/server.crt ~/.config/ikigai/gonk/quic/peers/plasma/server.crt
```

The directory holds `client.crt`, `client.key` and the `server.crt` to pin — the same layout
`ikigai --cert-dir` uses, and the same one `ikigai-gonk client add` writes for gonk's own
clients. `gonk.mount` is the ONLY key that names it, and `urn:llm:` is the only prefix a
mount line may claim: a mount is composed in front of the local spaces and its catalog is
served through every door, so what these doors can serve stays a property of the manifest
plus one namespace.

**What a derivation costs, and what bounds it.** Each grain has a provider and a `max_tokens`
ceiling (`gonk.explain.*`), and the ceiling is the only bound on one call — a thinking model
with no ceiling burns the budget on reasoning and returns nothing. Over time the bound is the
**archive**: an explanation is keyed by `(path, content-hash, version-tag)` in this dataset
and derived once per content version, so the second read of an unchanged file is a store
read. Measured on a scratch repository against `quic://127.0.0.1:4433`: the file grain
derived in **10.2s** on `qwen3-coder:30b` and came back from the archive in **13ms**; the
directory rollup derived in 61s on a 70B model, because a rollup asks the default tier.

A model swap on the peer re-keys the archive by itself: the version tag folds the model
identity `ikigai-browse` resolves through `urn:llm:{provider}:model` at explain time, which
is why gonk sets no model label. A `provider=` argument may name only the tiers this server
already asks with — widening that set would let anyone who may explain point this server at
any backend the peer holds, and that is not a caller's decision.

**Who may spend** is [the doors table](#the-three-doors), and the short form is that an
anonymous HTTP caller holds no browse grant at all, so it can neither derive an explanation
nor read an archived one, while the socket door's root can do both.

## Reviewing on a git event

A commit can put its changed files in front of the review pass. **The queue is the bound**:
a commit touching forty files drops forty requests, and they come back out one at a time.
Nothing decides a file was not worth reviewing.

```toml
gonk.review.space = "reviews"        # bind the queue at urn:space:reviews
# gonk.review.grant = "reviewer"     # the grant a pass WOULD run under; see below
# gonk.review.root = "~/.ikigai/spaces"
```

```text
urn:space:{name}              the queue — rd (list/read), out (drop), take (claim, atomic)
urn:iki:gonk:review:pass      one tuple -> one review pass
```

### ⚠⚠ The trigger is complete and deliberately UNARMED

Nothing in this binary drains the queue, and that is the feature rather than an omission.
**Nothing is published to gonk except by a human.** A review pass mints its findings as
annotations as its terminal step, so a pass that ran with nobody present would publish with
nobody present.

What stops it is **the authority, not a flag**. A pass needs

```text
urn:cap:browse:read:*
urn:cap:net:localhost     # the narrow form; the `urn:cap:net:*` wildcard is refused as a grant
urn:cap:annotate
urn:cap:store:read:graph:urn:iki:browse:graph:default
urn:cap:store:write:graph:urn:iki:browse:graph:default
```

and **this server mints none of the first three for anybody** — they have no provisioning
flag at all. So there is nothing for an unattended drainer to run under, and there is no
unattended drainer. What arms it is a *pending* state for a finding, so that a pass produces
something a person then publishes; that is a change in `ikigai-browse`, where the minting
is, not a line in this file. Configuring `gonk.review.space` binds the queue and arms
nothing.

`gonk.review.grant` is read and checked at startup, and printed on the banner, so an
operator can see what a pass *would* run under before anything can use it. Nothing runs one.

### Filling the queue from a hook

```sh
ikigai-gonk review request <repo> <path>
```

opens no store, binds no door and dials nothing: it writes one file into the queue and
exits. It works while gonk is down, which is the property a `post-commit` hook needs — a
commit must never wait on this server, let alone on a model. Dropping a request spends
nothing and needs no grant: **a tuple is a request, not an authority.**

Identical requests collapse. The drop is content-addressed and a request is exactly
`(repo, path)`, so the same file committed three times while the queue waits is one entry —
and the pass reads the file's content hash from the live tree when it runs, so what gets
reviewed is the current content, exactly as it would be for someone clicking **review**.

⚠ That is also why a request carries **no commit SHA**: a SHA would make every drop unique
and the queue would grow rather than collapse. The trade is deliberate.

### Draining it, by hand, over the socket

```text
source urn:space:reviews                                # what is waiting
source urn:space:reviews tuple=<id> | urn:iki:gonk:review:pass
delete urn:space:reviews tuple=<id>                     # once its findings are yours
```

⚠ The later stages of a pipeline are **bare IRIs** — `| urn:iki:gonk:review:pass`, not
`| source urn:…`, which fails with `invalid IRI: No scheme found`.

The read is non-destructive, so a pass is spent only when a person asks for it, and the
request stays queued until they say it is done. The queue's three tokens
(`urn:cap:space:{out,read,take}`) are minted by nobody either, so neither network door can
reach it — this is the owner-only socket's work.

**"Is this file already queued?" is a query, not a scan.** A request is Turtle, so the
intray's associative match selects over it:

```text
source urn:space:reviews match="PREFIX ik: <https://ikigai-rs.dev/ns#>
                                ASK { ?s ik:repo \"ikigai-gonk\" ; ik:path \"src/k.rs\" }"
```

returns the ids of the requests that match, and `delete … match=<the same ASK>` claims the
first of them. That is the reason a request is RDF rather than a line of text — a non-RDF
tuple can never be selected by a template.

**The trigger and the button are one call with two causes.** A pass issues
`Source urn:repo:{repo}:review:{path}` with `as=application/json` and nothing else — the
same IRI the **review** button sends, so both land on one archive entry and one set of
minted annotations. `ikigai-browse` holds that from its side
(`the_button_and_a_trigger_are_one_call_with_two_causes`) and `tests/trigger.rs` holds
gonk's. Nothing here assembles a prompt, post-processes a finding, or writes an annotation.

### What this server will not read

`ikigai-intray`'s reactor takes its authority from a `cap` file beside the space, and that
file **mints** a capability rather than narrowing one — from a directory anything that can
drop a request can also write. gonk refuses to start beside one. Authority here is a grant
in `grants.json`, checked the same way a certificate's and a passkey's are.

## The three doors

| door | reaches it | runs under |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **HTTP**, `127.0.0.1:1060` | any process on this machine | anonymously, the read and write tokens of the ledgers in `gonk.http.ledger` (default: `default`); signed in, that plus the passkey's grant; nothing for a non-loopback peer, a foreign `Host`, or a cross-site write |
| **socket**, `~/.ikigai/gonk.sock` | this user only (`0600`, peer UID checked) | root — the socket's owner can already read the dataset's files |
| **QUIC**, `udp 0.0.0.0:1060` | a certificate under `gonk/quic/clients/` | the grant its fingerprint maps to in `gonk/clients.json`; refused when it maps to none |

**Anonymously, the HTTP door is loopback only and grants little.** It can list, file,
comment, close, claim, label and link in its ledgers. It cannot delete or purge, cannot reach
another ledger, and cannot touch the store's whole-dataset doors (`urn:iki:store:select`,
`urn:iki:store:update`), because none of those tokens are in its grant. A passkey adds exactly
its grant and nothing else.

**And with browse roots configured, that argument has to be re-made, because more is now
compiled in.** `urn:repo:*` reads files off the disk and runs `git`; `urn:system:exec` runs a
named tool; `urn:iki:annotation` writes to the dataset. What each door reaches:

| family | anonymous HTTP | signed-in HTTP | socket | QUIC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| the configured ledgers | read + write | + the passkey's grant | all | per grant |
| `urn:repo:{root}:*` (`urn:cap:browse:read:{root}`) | **no** | only if the grant names it | yes (root) | only if the grant names it |
| `urn:iki:annotation` (`urn:cap:annotate`) | **no** | only if the grant names it | yes (root) | only if the grant names it |
| `urn:repo:{status,log,…}`, `urn:system:exec` (`urn:cap:exec:{tool}`) | **no** | only if the grant names it | yes (root) | only if the grant names it |
| `urn:iki:store:graph-*` over the BROWSE graph (`urn:cap:store:read:graph:urn:iki:browse:graph:default`) | **no** | only if the grant names it — `passkey invite … --browse-graph read` | yes (root) | only if the grant names it |
| `urn:iki:store:select` and the other broad doors (`urn:cap:store:read`) | **no** | **no** — this server hands the broad tokens to nobody | yes (root) | **no** — refused in `grants.json` |
| `urn:repo:{root}:{explain,review}`, `pr:{n}:{explain,review}` — **spends model tokens** (`urn:cap:net:{host}`, plus `urn:cap:annotate` for the two reviews) | **no** | only if the grant names it | yes (root) | only if the grant names it |
| `urn:llm:*` on the mounted peer (`urn:cap:net:{host}`) | **no** | only if the grant names it | yes (root) | only if the grant names it |

**Deriving is the privileged act, and it is one capability away from every door.** Explaining
a file, reviewing one, or explaining a pull request calls a model on the mounted peer, which
costs the operator tokens and — where the peer is metered — money. `ikigai-browse` declares
that as `urn:cap:net:*` (the offering wildcard) on every derivation, and `declared =
enforced`, so a caller with no net grant is refused before dispatch and never appears in
front of a model. **This server mints no net grant**: `ikigai-gonk grants`, `client add` and
`passkey invite` write per-ledger and per-graph store tokens only, so an identity that may derive is one an
operator wrote by hand into `grants.json`, naming the host
(`urn:cap:net:localhost`) — the wildcard itself is refused there, like `urn:cap:exec:*`.

⚠ **A net grant is the authority to spend that peer's inference, not only to explain.** The
mount serves the peer's whole `urn:llm:` namespace through every door, so the same grant that
derives an explanation can `source urn:llm:ask` directly — and a direct ask is neither
archived nor bounded by the `gonk.explain.*` ceilings, because those are arguments this
server passes to an explain, not a policy the mount enforces. What bounds it is the peer's
own ceiling (`ikigai serve quic://… --cap urn:cap:net:localhost` grants inference and nothing
else) and the fact that reaching the mount at all takes a grant nothing here mints.

★ **The browse-graph row is new, and it is the one thing the graph decision bought.** Until
2026-09-16 browse's quads lived in the store's DEFAULT graph, which has no IRI — so no
`urn:cap:store:read:graph:` token could name them and every query over an annotation or an
archived explanation needed root. They now live in `urn:iki:browse:graph:default`, and that
token is mintable:

```
ikigai-gonk grants --browse-graph read      # print the token
ikigai-gonk passkey invite reader --browse-graph read
ikigai-gonk client add box --ledger default=read --browse-graph read
```

What it carries is **quads in one graph** — every annotation, every archived explanation,
every review finding, through `urn:iki:store:graph-{select,ask,construct,describe}`. That is
the archive **without the spend**: reading an explanation through `urn:repo:{root}:explain`
requires the `urn:cap:net:*` that deriving one does, and this route requires none. What it
does not carry is the browse family: no file contents, no tree, no `gh`, no deriving, and no
other graph. ⚠ And it is not given to the anonymous HTTP caller, whose grant stays exactly
`gonk.http.ledger`'s ledgers — signing in is how the HTTP door spells "a caller who may".

★ **And since `ikigai-store` 0.2.5 the two read tokens together RUN THE LEDGER↔BROWSE JOIN** —
the query the graph decision was for, below root at last. A scoped read takes a SET of graphs:

```
ikigai-gonk client add box --ledger default=read --browse-graph read
```

```sparql
# urn:iki:store:graph-select, graph="urn:iki:ledger:graph:default urn:iki:browse:graph:default"
SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?file ?note WHERE {
  GRAPH <urn:iki:ledger:graph:default> { ?item ledger:about ?file }
  GRAPH <urn:iki:browse:graph:default> { ?a ik:annotates ?file ; oa:bodyValue ?note }
}
```

Three things about it are worth knowing before you write one, and each is a test here
(`a_scoped_token_reads_browse_and_both_tokens_run_the_join`):

- ⚠ **The set is ONE `graph` value, separated by whitespace.** `graph=A graph=B` is a repeated
  named argument, and the engine keeps the LAST value silently — so the repeated spelling asks
  for one graph and the join comes back empty with nothing said. That is upstream of this
  server (and of the store), and it is pinned here so a fix shows up as a red test.
- **A graph you hold no token for refuses the WHOLE read**, naming every missing
  `urn:cap:store:read:graph:` token — never an answer computed over the half you do hold.
- **The join is UNCACHED, and the ledger's own scoped read is not.** A multi-graph read is
  covered only if every member is, and browse's graph is written by the sharer. So the join is
  a fresh query every time by construction; the ~1000× on the ledger's hot read is untouched.

⚠ **`SELECT DISTINCT`** wherever a triple could be in both graphs: oxigraph's merged default
graph is a bag, so a triple present in two members matches once per member.

Three things make that table true rather than aspirational. `ikigai-gonk grants` mints
per-ledger and per-graph tokens only, so nothing this server writes into a grant names browse
(the family), exec or the whole dataset. `grants.json` is refused at startup if any grant names a whole-dataset store
token **or the exec wildcard `urn:cap:exec:*`** — which `ikigai-repo` declares as an
*offering* ("holds some grant under this prefix") and which as a *grant* means every program
on the machine; the per-tool spelling `urn:cap:exec:git` is what that crate enforces at
dispatch and what an operator means. And `urn:kernel:actions` is capability-scoped by
construction, so an anonymous caller asking "what can I do?" is offered no browse row, no
facade, no broad store door and no derivation — `tests/browse.rs` asserts both halves, the
offer and the typed `Denied`, for a caller with per-ledger tokens, for one with a browse
grant and no net grant, and for one with both.

**The socket door is root, and root now reaches further.** An owner-only socket client can
read any file under a configured root and run `git`/`gh` through the facades. That is
authority the same user already has — the socket is `0600` with the peer UID checked, and
whoever holds it can read the dataset's files and run `git` themselves — but it IS a wider
surface than before, and it is reached by mounting this socket, so a host that mounts gonk
mounts all of it.

**Every door shares one kernel.** A kernel owns its cache and its golden threads, and each
transport takes one by value; separate kernels over one store would let a write through one
door leave another serving the read it cached before. So there is one kernel, the hub, and
every door forwards to it under a cache that stores nothing. The HTTP door's kernel adds the
pages in front and a not-found catch-all behind, and its pages never cache; every ledger read
a page makes is a hub read.

## Remote access, later — what it will take

The HTTP door refuses a non-loopback bind, and that refusal stays until all of these exist:

1. **TLS.** WebAuthn needs a secure context. `http://localhost` is one and `http://` on a LAN
   never is, so a passkey cannot work off loopback without HTTPS.
2. **A real relying-party name.** The RP ID is `localhost` today, and an IP address cannot be
   one. A remote face needs a domain name, and a passkey registered for `localhost` does not
   carry over to it; people re-enrol.
3. **No anonymous grant off loopback.** A non-loopback peer already gets an empty anonymous
   capability, so everything it can do would come from its passkey. That is the property
   that makes a remote bind meaningful. The bind refusal should lift only for a TLS listener,
   so the anonymous-loopback grant can never face a network.
4. **The cookie question revisited.** A remote session should be an `HttpOnly`, `Secure`
   cookie set by the server, which needs a transport that can set response headers.

Until then, other machines use the QUIC door.

## What it refuses

- **A non-loopback HTTP bind.** `--bind 0.0.0.0:1060` stops the server before it opens
  anything, and says to use QUIC.
- **A second holder of the store.** Another gonk, or an `ikigai` with `store = true`, holding
  the dataset stops this one with the path and the mount lines that fix it.
- **The store's broad tokens in any grant.** `urn:cap:store:read` is every graph and
  `urn:cap:store:write` is `DROP ALL`. A `grants.json` naming either stops the server at
  startup, and a connection or session whose grant names one is refused. The store's narrow
  write door refuses the broad key anyway, so such a grant could not write either.
- **A certificate it trusts but has no grant for**, or whose grant is unknown or empty. The
  refusal is logged with the full fingerprint.
- **A QUIC door it was told to open and cannot.** A named QUIC bind with no client
  certificate enrolled, or a certificate enrolled with no `client.crt` trusted, stops the
  server. Neither case generates the server identity first.
- **An unreadable authority file.** A `clients.json` (certificates or passkeys) or
  `grants.json` that exists and does not parse stops the server rather than serving under a
  guess.
- **A passkey ceremony that is not exactly right**: the wrong origin (an IP address instead of
  `localhost`), a reused or expired challenge, a used or expired invite, a key that is not
  P-256, an assertion without user verification, or a signature counter that went backwards.
- **More than 256 outstanding challenges or sessions.** Past the bound a new one is refused;
  nobody else's in-flight sign-in is evicted.
- **A `gonk.*` config key it does not read**, and a socket path too long to bind.
- **A browse root that is not there, is named twice, or is named something that reads as
  another family** (`pr`, `style`, or a name containing `:`, `/`, `{`, `}`). A missing
  directory looks exactly like an unconfigured root once the server is up — a resolution
  miss — so it is refused while there is still somewhere to print the reason.
- **A grant naming `urn:cap:exec:*`**, the offering wildcard, which as a grant is every
  program on this machine. Name the tools: `urn:cap:exec:git`, `urn:cap:exec:gh`.
- **A grant naming `urn:cap:net:*`**, the offering wildcard `ikigai-browse` declares on every
  derivation, which as a grant is every host this kernel could dial. Name the host:
  `urn:cap:net:localhost`. Both wildcards are checked at startup and again per connection,
  because the file is re-read per connection.
- **A `gonk.mount` line that is not `prefer urn:llm:=<target>`**: another mode, another
  prefix, a `quic://` target with no certificate directory (or one that is not there), a
  socket target WITH one, or two lines claiming the same prefix.
- **A `gonk.explain.*.provider` outside `urn:llm:`**, which nothing in this process could
  resolve, or a `max_tokens` that is not a positive number — a ceiling is the only bound on
  what one derivation costs, so a typo in it must stop the server rather than fall back.

## Backup and restore

**gonk holds the only writer lock, so gonk is the only thing that can export the dataset.**
RocksDB permits one writer per directory; a second process cannot open `~/.ikigai/store` to
dump it, and `cp -r` of a live directory is a torn snapshot — SST files and the write-ahead
log mutate under the copy, and the result may not open, or may open and be quietly short.
Backup is therefore a face this server offers, not an ops script someone runs beside it.

```
ikigai --connect ~/.ikigai/gonk.sock -c 'source urn:iki:gonk:backup'           # take one now
ikigai --connect ~/.ikigai/gonk.sock -c 'source urn:iki:gonk:backup:status'    # when the last good one was
```

⚠ **`--connect` is part of the command, not decoration.** The backup family is bound behind
the owner-only socket and is not one of the prefixes a `mount` line in the config home claims
(`urn:iki:store:` and `urn:iki:ledger:` are), so a bare `ikigai -c 'source
urn:iki:gonk:backup'` does not reach this server. By default a backup is taken **every 24
hours**, compressed, and the **last five** are kept in `~/.ikigai/backups`.

### The format is N-Quads, and the easy mistake is Turtle

**CONSTRUCT returns triples.** This dataset is partitioned by named graph — one per named
ledger, its graveyard beside it, and browse's own (`urn:iki:browse:graph:default`,
`src/browse.rs`'s `Graph`) — and that partition is what every per-graph capability is written
against. A backup serialized as Turtle or N-Triples collapses every graph into one: the quad
count still matches, every triple round-trips, and the restored dataset has every tenant's
statements in the default graph with the tenancy boundary gone — which is also, exactly, the
shape a browse-graph migration has to avoid producing.

So an archive is N-Quads, gzipped, and every comparison this server makes about one is
**per graph**. The dump is `urn:iki:store:select` read back through oxigraph's own
SPARQL-results parser and written by oxigraph's own N-Quads serializer — neither end is
string surgery, which matters because ledger bodies contain newlines, quotation marks and
trailing periods, and those are exactly the rows a hand-rolled writer corrupts.

Compression is `urn:compress:gzip`, resolved **through the kernel**, which is why
[`ikigai-compress`](https://github.com/ikigai-rs/ikigai-compress) is a dependency rather
than `flate2`. Its header is pinned, so two backups of unchanged data are byte-identical and
"has anything changed" is a digest comparison; the dump is `ORDER BY`ed to make that true of
the input as well.

### A merge is not a restore

Loading an archive into a store that already holds quads is a **union**: it resurrects
everything either side deleted and can never reproduce the backed-up state. So a restore
builds a **new** store directory, and refuses a target that is not empty — or that is the
live store, by name.

```
ikigai --connect ~/.ikigai/gonk.sock -c \
  'source urn:iki:gonk:backup:archive:gonk-store-2026-09-16T172813Z.nq.gz \
   | sink urn:iki:gonk:restore into=/tmp/restored'
```

That leaves a complete dataset beside the live one and tells you the graph set and the
per-graph counts it verified. Adopting it is an operator's act, with the server stopped:
swap the directories and start gonk. The destructive step is visible, manual, and happens
when nothing is writing.

`urn:iki:gonk:restore` is also the **verifier**: it compares the restored dataset's graph set
and per-graph counts against the archive it was built from and fails if they differ. A backup
you have not restored is not a backup, so `tests/backup.rs` restores one on every run.

### The two most dangerous grants in the system

A backup reads **every** graph, which is precisely the authority the per-graph boundary
exists to avoid handing out; a restore builds a store from bytes the caller supplies. Both
live behind the **owner-only socket**, whose caller can read the dataset's files anyway —
its own door, not a flag on the public one:

| token | what it is | who can hold it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `urn:cap:gonk:backup` | take a backup, read the status, read an archive | the socket door's root capability, and nothing else |
| `urn:cap:gonk:restore` | build a store from an archive | the same |
| `urn:cap:store:read` | every graph (declared by `urn:iki:gonk:backup`, because it really reads them) | the same |

`gonk/grants.json` is **refused at startup** if it names any of them, exactly as it is for
the store's broad tokens and the offering wildcards: a grant a reader could mistake for a
narrowing must not be silently the opposite. `tests/doors.rs` drives the real HTTP door and
asserts a `403` on every one of these, alongside `urn:iki:store:info` — the posture that had
to survive this feature.

### The schedule, and why it is not `urn:time:schedule`

The job runs in an `ikigai-time` `JobRegistry` inside this process. **The control plane is
deliberately not bound**: `urn:time:schedule` fires an arbitrary target under the registry's
own capability, so binding it behind three doors would be a way to have this server issue any
request as itself. The target set is fixed at startup by `main`; the registry fires under
exactly `urn:cap:gonk:backup` and `urn:cap:store:read`, so a scheduled backup can read every
graph and write the rotation, and cannot write a single quad.

It lives here rather than on the host daemon's scheduler for one reason: **a backup job must
not be able to outlive the thing it protects.** An external scheduler's failure mode is "gonk
is healthy, data is changing, backups stopped, nobody knows". If gonk schedules its own
backup, "gonk is down" also means "nothing is being written", and a missed backup is harmless.

Two things make the schedule trustworthy rather than merely present:

- **A recurring timer's first tick is one whole interval away.** A daily job on a
  `KeepAlive` daemon whose machine reboots nightly never reaches it — silently, with a
  schedule that looks correct in every readout. So startup reads the rotation directory's
  newest sidecar and, if the last backup is older than the cadence (or there is none),
  schedules a one-shot catch-up a minute out.
- **`urn:iki:gonk:backup:status` answers from both sides.** A scheduled job that *hangs*
  reads stale forever and never reads failing, and gonk is not heartbeat-watched. The status
  reports the newest archive actually on disk with its per-graph counts and digests, the
  whole rotation, and the timer's own health — runs, time since the last run, time since the
  last **success**, failures in a row. A job that never fired shows as a growing "since last
  run"; a job that fires and fails shows as "failures in a row". `as=application/json` gives
  the same thing to a machine.

## Configuration

Flags override config wholesale; there is no environment-variable channel. The config home
is `~/.config/ikigai` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ikigai`).

```toml
# ~/.config/ikigai/config.toml
gonk.bind = "127.0.0.1:1060"          # or gonk.port = 1060, which always means loopback
gonk.socket = "~/.ikigai/gonk.sock"
# gonk.quic.bind = "0.0.0.0:1060"     # unset: QUIC opens here once a certificate is enrolled;
                                      # set: QUIC must open, or gonk refuses to start
gonk.http.ledger = "default"          # repeatable
gonk.browse.root = "core=~/git-personal/ikigai-core"   # repeatable; unset, no browse family
gonk.mount = "prefer urn:llm:=quic://127.0.0.1:4433 ~/.config/ikigai/gonk/quic/peers/plasma"
# gonk.explain.file.provider = "urn:llm:coder:ask"     # the tiers, and the per-call ceilings
# gonk.explain.file.max_tokens = 400                   # file 400, dir 600, review 800, pr 600
# gonk.explain.dir.provider = "urn:llm:ask"            # .dir / .review / .pr take the same pair
# gonk.explain.max_prompt_bytes = 16384
gonk.backup.every = "24h"             # the cadence; "off" (or --no-backup) takes none
# gonk.backup.keep = 5                # how many archives the rotation keeps
# gonk.backup.dir = "~/.ikigai/backups"
# gonk.review.space = "reviews"       # bind the git-event review QUEUE; arms nothing
# gonk.review.grant = "reviewer"      # the grant a pass WOULD run under; nothing runs one
# gonk.review.root = "~/.ikigai/spaces"
```

A `gonk.browse.root` line is what composes `urn:repo:*` and `ikigai-repo`'s facades at all.
The name is spliced into `urn:repo:<name>:…`, so it may not contain `:`, `/`, `{` or `}`, may
not repeat, and may not be `pr` or `style` (those read as the other family's names); the
directory must exist. Each is refused at startup with the line to edit — `ikigai-browse`
would assert instead, which arrives as a panic where the banner should be.

| file | what it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `store.toml`, `gonk.store.toml` | `path = "…"` — where the dataset lives, read by `ikigai-store` |
| `gonk/clients.json` | identity → grant name: certificate fingerprints under `clients` (the same shape `ikigai serve quic://…` reads), passkeys under `passkeys` |
| `gonk/grants.json` | grant name → capability scopes (the same shape as the cli's `grants.json`) |
| `gonk/invites.json` | outstanding passkey invites, by the SHA-256 of their codes |
| `gonk/render-rules.ttl` | this deployment's render rules, replacing the shipped table wholesale |
| `gonk/quic/` | `server.crt`, `server.key`, and one `clients/<name>/` bundle per client |
| `~/.ikigai/backups/` | the rotation: `gonk-store-<stamp>.nq.gz` and a `.meta.json` sidecar each |

## What it composes

The manifest is the module manifest: gonk links
[`ikigai-store`](https://github.com/ikigai-rs/ikigai-store) with its RocksDB backend,
[`ikigai-ledger`](https://github.com/ikigai-rs/ikigai-ledger),
[`ikigai-browse`](https://github.com/ikigai-rs/ikigai-browse) and
[`ikigai-repo`](https://github.com/ikigai-rs/ikigai-repo), the `ikigai-web`, `ikigai-ipc` and
`ikigai-quic` transports, and `ikigai-resolve` for the mount. For the backup family it adds
[`ikigai-compress`](https://github.com/ikigai-rs/ikigai-compress) — whose four resources ARE
bound, because an archive reaches gzip by resolving `urn:compress:gzip` through this kernel —
and `ikigai-time`, whose `JobRegistry` fires the schedule and whose `urn:time:*` control plane
is deliberately **not** bound. For the browser face it adds two libraries it calls as
functions and binds no resources from: `ikigai-xslt` (the stylesheet engine) and
`ikigai-passkey` (the assertion verifier). **No LLM client** — the model is mounted, never
linked.

⚠ **That is a correction, and it has now been made twice.** Through 0.1.0 this section said
"no filesystem module, no process execution and no outbound network client is compiled in, so
none is reachable whatever a grant says". The browse family made two of those three false:
`urn:repo:{root}:file` and `:tree` read the filesystem under a configured root, and
`urn:repo:{status,log,branch}`, `urn:repo:pr:*` and `urn:system:exec` spawn `git` and `gh`.

**The third has now changed too, and it is worth stating exactly rather than dropping.** With
a `gonk.mount` line, gonk opens an outbound connection — QUIC, or a Unix socket — **to one
peer named in its config, presenting one client certificate, speaking ikigai's own wire
protocol**. That is narrower than what the old sentence ruled out in three ways that matter:

- **No HTTP client is linked, and none is reachable.** `urn:httpGet` and its family are not
  bound here; `ikigai-llm` is not a dependency. A capability cannot produce a request to an
  arbitrary URL, because nothing in this process can build one.
- **The address is config, not an argument.** A caller cannot say where to connect. The peer
  is the one `gonk.mount` names, and the only IRI prefix a mount line may claim is
  `urn:llm:` — so even an operator cannot quietly put another namespace behind these doors.
- **The peer's own ceiling is the far end.** `ikigai serve quic://… --cap urn:cap:net:localhost`
  admits gonk's certificate to inference and to nothing else on that machine.

What it is NOT narrower in: reaching the peer at all is a capability question now
(`urn:cap:net:{host}`), not a linkage question — and that capability spends tokens. See
[The three doors](#the-three-doors). All three families are **off unless configured**: with no
`gonk.browse.root` line neither browse nor the facades are bound, and with no `gonk.mount`
line the explanation families are not bound either, because an action no kernel in this
process can satisfy is an over-offer.

`tests/conformance.rs` pins the socket and QUIC catalog to the store's thirteen resources and the
ledger's fourteen, pins the HTTP door's to those plus its ten pages, and walks
`ikigai-conformance` over the hub, a door, and the HTTP door. `tests/browse.rs` pins the
browse composition's twenty more, in the hub and through a door, pins the five the mount adds
(and their absence without one), and pins the spend gate per capability. `tests/backup.rs`
pins the backup composition's eight more — gonk's four and compress's four — asserts that
`urn:time:schedule`, `urn:time:cancel` and `urn:time:jobs` are bound by nothing, and restores
a real archive, comparing the graph set and the per-graph counts rather than a total.

### One dataset, and what it costs

The annotation family takes a handle on the store, so its quads land in the same dataset the
ledgers live in and a ledger item joins an annotation on a repo file in one local query — the
point of composing them here rather than federating.

`ikigai-store` answers a bare handout (`open_shared`) by making **every** read
`Expiry::Always`, because a handle it cannot see is a writer it cannot see; and expiry
propagates, so that would have de-cached every ledger read as a side effect of adding a browse
face. Measured on a 247-item ledger, `urn:iki:ledger:items` goes from **11.9µs to 12.9ms** that
way — a thousandfold, with every test still passing and the types identical.

gonk does not accept that, and it does not have to, because it knows something the store
cannot: **who the other holder is and where it writes.** Since `ikigai-browse` 0.4.0 it knows
it the strongest way available — by **choosing**. `src/browse.rs`'s `Graph` is that choice,
made once in `main`, and the two statements that must agree about it are two readings of the
one value: `graph.sharer_writes()` opens the store, `browse::wire(…, &graph)` puts the same
value on the mount. There is no second place to edit.

Before 0.4.0 the promise was TRANSCRIBED: `main` wrote `SharerWrites::only_the_default_graph()`
because someone had read browse's three writers and found `GraphName::DefaultGraph` hard-coded
in each. That is a fact about a dependency's internals, re-typed in a consumer, with a comment
asking the next person to keep it true — and a transcribed invariant drifts. Today `main` does
not name `SharerWrites` at all.

The choice since 2026-09-16 is **`urn:iki:browse:graph:default`** (see *Giving browse its own
graph* below, and read it before upgrading a store that has one), so the store answers
freshness per read from that promise: a scoped read
(`urn:iki:store:graph-{select,ask,construct,describe}`), whose universe is one NAMED graph by
construction, is cacheable under the store's own three write threads **for every graph the
promise does not name** — and that is what every ledger read is made of. Declared, the same
read is **10.9µs**. The broad faces stay uncacheable, by name:
`urn:iki:store:{select,ask,construct,describe}`, `urn:iki:store:info`, and therefore
`urn:iki:ledger:ledgers`, which asks *which graphs exist* through the broad door.

★ **What naming a graph costs is that graph's cacheability, and nothing else's.** A scoped
read of `urn:iki:browse:graph:default` is `Expiry::Always` — the sharer may write it, and the
store says so per read rather than this crate declaring it anywhere. The ledger's reads are
untouched, and that is measured rather than argued: the same 247-item corpus, the same
composition, once with browse in the default graph and once with it in its own.

```
--- 247 items, mean of 20 reads ---
  owned     (open — no browse face)                  items    12.16µs  next    13.42µs
  shared    (open_shared, undeclared)                items    12.63ms  next    22.60ms
  declared  (browse in the DEFAULT graph)            items    10.82µs  next    12.70µs
  declared  (browse in its NAMED graph — shipped)    items    10.85µs  next    12.43µs
```

⚠ **A false promise there would be silent, unbounded staleness** — reads of a graph the sharer
does write, cached against threads its writes never cut. So the promise is not left to a
comment: `tests/browse.rs` prints all three numbers and takes the store's own
`reserved_graphs_fingerprint()` either side of a real browse write, which fingerprints the
**quads** of every reserved graph rather than the set of graph names, and errors rather than
passing vacuously on a store that promised nothing.

⚠⚠ **And either side of a real browse READ**, which is why the manifest takes 0.4.0 rather
than staying where it was. Through 0.3.2, browse's annotation reads passed no graph at all —
in `quads_for_pattern` that means *every graph* — and `annotate::refresh` rewrites a drifted
annotation **during a Source**. Together those made a plain read destructive across a graph
boundary: it re-anchored an annotation-shaped quad sitting in another writer's named graph and
persisted the move. gonk, with one dataset shared between browse and a graph-scoped ledger, is
exactly the host that had something to lose, and it would have lost it twice — the other
writer's quads relocated, and this server's coverage promise false from that moment on.
`a_browse_read_touches_no_reserved_graph` states it; built against 0.3.2 it fails on the
visibility half and, with that assertion removed, again on the write-back half.

### Giving browse its own graph — and upgrading a store that predates it

**Since 2026-09-16 browse's quads live in `urn:iki:browse:graph:default`.** Before that they
were in the store's default graph, which has no IRI: no `urn:cap:store:*:graph:` token could
name them, so every query over an annotation or an archived explanation was a root one, and
the ledger↔browse join was reachable from the socket door and from nowhere else.

⚠⚠ **This is a data migration, not a setting, and the failure mode is silence.** A binary
carrying this choice reads and writes ONE graph. Quads an older gonk wrote into the default
graph are still on disk and are no longer visible to any browse read — the annotation panel is
empty, the archive is empty, a review's findings are gone, and **nothing errors, at any
layer**. New explanations land in the named graph and never join the old ones.

So gonk counts them before the doors open, using `ikigai-browse`'s own counting function — the
number in the banner is the number `migrate-annotation-ns` prints:

```
ikigai-gonk: ⚠⚠ THE BROWSE ARCHIVE IS INVISIBLE — 10 quad(s) are outside <urn:iki:browse:graph:default>
```

**The upgrade, in order. gonk must be STOPPED for step 4** — it holds the RocksDB write lock,
so the migration cannot run beside it, and it should not: the migration is a rewrite of the
dataset this server is serving.

```sh
# 1. the migration tool (a feature-gated binary of ikigai-browse, not shipped with gonk)
cargo install ikigai-browse --version 0.4.0 --locked --features migrate --bin migrate-annotation-ns

# 2. a backup, taken through the running server — it is the only thing that can export the
#    dataset, and `--commit` in step 5 cannot be undone by restarting
ikigai --connect ~/.ikigai/gonk.sock -c 'source urn:iki:gonk:backup'
ikigai --connect ~/.ikigai/gonk.sock -c 'source urn:iki:gonk:backup:status'   # confirm it succeeded

# 3. what is there now, read-only, through the socket — no lock taken
ikigai --connect ~/.ikigai/gonk.sock -c \
  'source urn:iki:store:select query="SELECT (COUNT(*) AS ?n) WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }"'

# 4. STOP gonk — the store has one writer
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/dev.ikigai-rs.gonk        # or however it is supervised

# 5. migrate: dry run first, and it prints PASS/FAIL with the four counts
migrate-annotation-ns ~/.ikigai/store --graph urn:iki:browse:graph:default
migrate-annotation-ns ~/.ikigai/store --graph urn:iki:browse:graph:default --commit

# 6. install the new binary, THEN start it — a gonk with the new choice must not run against
#    an unmigrated store, and a gonk with the old one must not run against a migrated one
cargo install --path . --locked                          # or the released version
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.ikigai-rs.gonk.plist

# 7. the banner says where the quads land, and says nothing about a migration
#      browse  urn:repo:{…}:* — annotations and archive in <urn:iki:browse:graph:default>
```

⚠ **Steps 5 and 6 are one window, in that order.** Migrating first and starting the OLD binary
strands the quads the other way (it reads the default graph and the data is now in the named
one) — gonk says so too, but the window is a window either way. Keep it short.

**After the migration**, two things are an operator's and neither is automatic:

- **Grants.** Nobody holds the browse graph's tokens until someone mints them —
  `ikigai-gonk grants --browse-graph read`, or `--browse-graph read` on `passkey invite` /
  `client add`. See *The three doors*.
- **Saved queries.** Any query of yours that read browse's quads as a bare pattern now
  matches nothing, silently. Wrap that half in `GRAPH <urn:iki:browse:graph:default> { … }`.
  Backups need no change: an archive is N-Quads and every comparison this server makes about
  one is per graph, so the browse graph simply appears as a graph.

### Importing an archive from another host's store

A gonk that starts with browse roots configured has an **empty** browse graph, and pays in
inference for the first explanation of everything. If another host has already derived that
archive over the SAME directories — a standalone `ikigai-dev-server`, or another gonk — the
archive can be carried across rather than re-derived. The tool is `migrate-archive-roots`, a
second feature-gated binary of `ikigai-browse`, and it is a different operation from the
in-place move above on every axis: two stores, only the target written; a source that may stay
LIVE, because it is opened read-only; and roots RENAMED on the way, because the two hosts
need not have named the same directories the same thing.

★ **The root name is inside the data, in five places, and a partial rewrite is silent.** The
subject IRI (`urn:ikigai:browse:explain:{root}:…`, `…:review:{root}:…`), the `ik:repo`
literal, and three object positions (`ik:about`, `ik:annotates`, `prov:used`) — plus
`prov:wasGeneratedBy` on an annotation, pointing at the review pass whose IRI also carries the
root, which is the one an obvious list misses. Rewrite some and not the others and the archive
is present, countable, SPARQL-visible and **answered by nothing**, because a read builds its
IRI from THIS host's root name. The tool keys on the IRI position rather than on a list of
predicates, and it refuses rather than guessing: every root the source mentions must be
mapped or dropped, every browse-minted subject must be assignable to a root, and no two roots
may be renamed onto one name.

⚠ **Identical root names on both hosts is the cheap way out of all of that**, because then
every rename is the identity and no IRI is rewritten at all. It is worth renaming this
server's roots to match the source's BEFORE the import rather than mapping afterwards; the
per-root `rewritten` column is `0` for every row when you have.

**The import, in order. gonk must be STOPPED for step 4 — it holds the target's writer
lock. The SOURCE host does not have to stop**: two different store paths, two different
locks, and the source is never written.

```sh
# 1. the tool — feature-gated, and NOT the same binary as the in-place move above. It arrived
#    in ikigai-browse 0.4.1; until that is on crates.io, build it from a checkout.
cargo install ikigai-browse --version 0.4.1 --locked --features migrate --bin migrate-archive-roots
#    or, from a checkout of ikigai-browse:
cargo build --release --features migrate --bin migrate-archive-roots

# 2. a backup, taken through the running server — `--commit` cannot be undone by restarting
ikigai --connect ~/.ikigai/gonk.sock -c 'source urn:iki:gonk:backup'
ikigai --connect ~/.ikigai/gonk.sock -c 'source urn:iki:gonk:backup:status'

# 3. the SURVEY: run it with no --root and no --drop at all. It prints one row per root the
#    source holds, with quad and explanation/review/annotation counts, and then refuses.
#    Both stores are open read-only here, so this runs against a live pair.
migrate-archive-roots <source-store> ~/.ikigai/store --graph urn:iki:browse:graph:default

# 4. STOP gonk — the store has one writer
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/dev.ikigai-rs.gonk        # or however it is supervised

# 5. decide every root, dry run, then commit. The dry run's "would be" column is the same
#    counting function over a projection of the plan, not a second prediction.
migrate-archive-roots <source-store> ~/.ikigai/store \
  --root ikigai-core=ikigai-core --root ikigai-cli=ikigai-cli \
  --drop some-root-this-host-does-not-serve \
  --graph urn:iki:browse:graph:default
#   … then the same line again with --commit

# 6. start gonk. The banner's unmigrated-quads check is about the GRAPH, not about this
#    import, so it says nothing either way — step 7 is the acceptance.
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.ikigai-rs.gonk.plist
```

⚠ **A root this host does not serve is a DROP, and a drop is a decision to state, not to
discover.** Carried under a name no root of this host produces, an archive is unreachable by
every read — which is the failure the tool exists to prevent — so it refuses the carry and
makes you write `--drop`. The survey's quad and explanation counts for that root are what the
drop costs, and they are worth reading before you type it.

⚠ **The import is a one-shot, not a sync.** Anything the source derives after it is not here.
Re-running is safe and cheap — the transfer is idempotent, and a second run reports every
quad as `already in target` and `new to target 0` — so re-run it immediately before retiring
the source rather than trusting the first run's numbers.

#### Verifying it — and the three ways a `0` lies

★ **The counts prove a copy happened; only a resolution proves the rewrite was right**, and
on this server the obvious count is the one thing that cannot tell you. Read an entry back:

```sh
# derives NOTHING by declaration, and joins on ik:about rather than the working tree —
# so an empty answer here for a path the archive holds is a migration defect
ikigai --connect ~/.ikigai/gonk.sock \
  -c 'source urn:repo:ikigai-core:explain-versions:src/lib.rs as=application/json'
```

⚠ **Never verify with a bare `explain`**: with a `gonk.mount` LLM peer configured it derives,
spends, and answers — which looks exactly like success. `explain-versions` derives nothing;
`explain … version={tag}` answers `NotFound` on a miss rather than falling back to a model.
Both are safe; `explain` alone is not.

And when you do count, count IN THE GRAPH, through a door that can see it. A `0` from this
server means three different things and only one of them is "the import did not run":

| what you ran | why it says `0` |
| --- | --- |
| `SELECT (COUNT(*)) WHERE { GRAPH <urn:iki:browse:graph:default> { ?s ?p ?o } }` at `/sparql`, anonymously | the browse graph is **outside the caller's scope** — the anonymous HTTP door holds its ledgers' tokens and nothing else, and a scoped read answers a graph outside the set *emptily rather than erroring* (see *Not built*) |
| `SELECT (COUNT(*)) WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }` through the socket | the pattern matches the store's **default graph**, which holds nothing: every quad here is in a named graph, and `urn:iki:store:select` does not union them into the default one |
| either of the above, correctly scoped | the import really did not run |

So the one query that answers the question is graph-named AND run where the graph is readable
— the socket door, or an identity holding `urn:cap:store:read:graph:urn:iki:browse:graph:default`:

```sh
ikigai --connect ~/.ikigai/gonk.sock -c 'source urn:iki:store:select as=text/csv \
  query="SELECT ?g (COUNT(*) AS ?n) WHERE { GRAPH ?g { ?s ?p ?o } } GROUP BY ?g"'
```

A per-root breakdown of what landed is the `ik:repo` literal, which the import rewrote to this
host's names — so it is also the check that the rename took:

```sh
ikigai --connect ~/.ikigai/gonk.sock -c 'source urn:iki:store:select as=text/csv \
  query="SELECT ?repo (COUNT(*) AS ?n) WHERE { GRAPH <urn:iki:browse:graph:default> { \
         ?s <https://ikigai-rs.dev/ns#repo> ?repo } } GROUP BY ?repo ORDER BY ?repo"'
```

A dropped root must not appear in it, and no root this server does not serve may either.

★ **A backup's own metadata is the cheapest before/after you will get**, and it needs no
query at all: `urn:iki:gonk:backup:status` prints per-graph counts, so a backup taken at step
2 and another after step 6 bracket the import in numbers this server produced itself.

### Watched roots, and why the reads are cached at all

`ikigai-browse` declares its `tree`, `file`, `hash` and `state` reads live and uncacheable,
which is the only honest declaration a *library* can make: caching is a promise that something
will notice when the file changes, and a library cannot know whether its host is watching. A
server can. gonk watches every configured root (FSEvents/inotify, recursively, `.git`
included — `state` is `git` output, so the refs are its input) and cuts one golden thread per
root, `urn:iki:gonk:browse:root:{name}`, on any change beneath it.

Only a **watched** root's reads are declared cacheable, and only for a plain `Source` with no
arguments: the HTML and `annotations=include` faces read the annotation overlay, which browse
rewrites during a read when a file has drifted, and that is state this thread does not track.
A root whose watcher fails to start is named on the banner as `live, unwatched` and its reads
are served exactly as browse declares them. There is no composition in which a read is cached
and unwatched — the failure the ecosystem already had once, where `urn:file:*` was cacheable
on a kernel with no watcher and a replaced stylesheet was served stale until restart, is the
failure this ordering exists to make impossible. Measured on a scratch root, a watched
`tree` read goes from 33.9µs to 6.7µs and a `file` read from 31.0µs to 8.3µs.

⚠ **Invalidation is asynchronous**, with the platform's own latency between the write and the
notification (FSEvents coalesces; a read issued in the same instant as the edit can still be
served from the cache). It is a bound of well under a second, not a correctness hole — the cut
always arrives — but a script that writes a file and reads it back with no gap can see the
previous version once.

`urn:repo:style` is browse's own: it is cacheable with a thread per `a11y.toml` candidate, and
gonk starts the watch that crate ships for them (`Mount::space_watched`), so an edit to
`~/.config/ikigai/gonk.a11y.toml` lands on the next read rather than the next restart.

★ **The browse page links TWO of browse's stylesheets, and both are that family's own
resources rather than anything of gonk's.** `urn:repo:style` is the syntax theme for the
`hl-` classes inside a file view; `urn:repo:style:layout` (`ikigai-browse` 0.4.2) is the page
furniture — crumbs, entry lists, the action strip, the disclosure menus, annotation cards,
the pull-request listings. Until that release the only copy of those rules anywhere was a
const string inside `ikigai-web`'s binary, so every other host served browse's markup
unstyled and this door rendered a tree as a cascade of gonk chips (ledger #441). Both links
are withheld from a caller who cannot read them, together, for the same reason.

`gonk.css` defines **no `browse-*` rule** and must not grow one: a rule here would silently
win against the family's own sheet and drift the moment browse changed its markup. When this
door knows the caller cannot annotate, it states that as a FACT on the shell —
`data-browse-posture="read-only"` — and the layout sheet decides what to hide. Presentation
only: the annotation Sink requires `urn:cap:annotate` whatever the page shows.

★ **Looking at these pages is a tool, not a ceremony:**
`cargo run --example page-preview -- <out-dir> [root=<path>]` writes the root list, a tree
page and a file page as files — the same bytes the door serves, with htmx's first swap
already done and both stylesheets beside them — under a capability the example states in one
place. It exists because the browse pages cannot be opened by hand: the only way to hold
`urn:cap:browse:read:*` over HTTP is a passkey ceremony in a browser. ⚠ It shows how a page
LOOKS and never what a caller may do; `tests/browse.rs` holds the second half. Serve the
directory with something that answers `/k…` a 403 and the page also shows what a caller who
may not use one affordance sees.

⚠ **A refusal from one affordance is not a page failure.** Every browse page fetches its
parts through affordances of its own, including a recent-pull-requests block that loads
itself; a caller without `urn:cap:exec:gh` gets a typed 403 there while the tree underneath
is fine. `web/gonk.js` writes such a message where the request came FROM — in place of that
block's "loading…", or beside the control that issued it — and only a 403 disables the
control, because an authority refusal is permanent for that grant while a 404 or a 503 is
not. ⚠ What this door still cannot do is decide UP FRONT whether a caller may use a control:
the kernel's rule for a wildcard requirement is `pub(crate)`, so "may this caller?" has no
public answer (ledger #439). Catching the refusal is the achievable half.

For the resources themselves — named ledgers, the grant table, delete versus purge, ordering
policies — see `ikigai-ledger`'s README.

## Port 1060

Port 1060 is the default for both HTTP (TCP) and QUIC (UDP), which are separate namespaces, so
one number names the server. It is also NetKernel's own port, registered with IANA as
`polestar`: a machine running both collides, which is why it is a default and not a constant.
`--port`, `--bind` and `--quic-bind` move it.

The name and the number are one tribute. GONK carries NK in order; the GNK power droid plods
around carrying charge so the rest of the scene can work. And 1060 is XML read as Roman
numerals and summed — X + M + L — for the orientation NetKernel 3 was built around.

## Running it as a service

A `launchd` agent needs only the binary; everything else comes from the config home.

## Not built

- **No identity reaches a write.** A form filed while signed in is not attributed to the
  passkey: the capability carries the grant, but nothing carries WHO to the ledger's `author`.
- **No manifold-driven forms yet.** The forms are hand-written in the stylesheet. They post
  only actions and inputs the ledger declares, and `/act` refuses anything else, but a new
  ledger input does not appear on the page until the stylesheet names it.
- **No graph visualization**, no live updates (a change made elsewhere shows on the next
  load), and no page without JavaScript for the in-place forms.
- **No passkey management commands** beyond `invite`: list and revoke by editing
  `clients.json`.
- **No certificate lifecycle.** No CA, expiry, rotation or distribution; see the QUIC
  section for what admission means.
- **No live reload of trusted certificates.** Grants and enrolments are re-read per QUIC
  connection; the certificate set is read at startup.
- **One trace per door.** A traced call through a door records the forward, not the hub's
  resolution beneath it.
- **No browse graph on the `/sparql` page — the join is reachable, the EDITOR is not where.**
  Since `ikigai-store` 0.2.5 a scoped read takes a set of graphs, so the join runs through
  every door: the socket door's owner holds root, and a QUIC certificate or a passkey identity
  whose grant carries both read tokens runs it with no root anywhere — over HTTP as the
  store's own resource under **this server's** mechanical path mapping
  (`GET /iki/store/graph-select?graph=<A>%20<B>&query=…` on port 1060, which
  `the_join_runs_through_the_http_door_under_a_signed_in_grant` drives end to end). ⚠ An
  earlier revision credited that path to `ikigai-web`. It is gonk's own door's mapping;
  `ikigai-web` writes the whole IRI in the path instead (`GET
  /urn:iki:store:graph-select?graph=…`, over a `mount = "prefer urn:iki:store:=…gonk.sock"`
  line), and mixing the two spellings earns a 404 that reads like a missing resource. What is
  not built is the join from the PAGE: the editor's box picks a LEDGER and the query runs
  against that ledger's graph alone, so `urn:iki:browse:graph:default` is invisible there
  whatever tokens the caller holds. A graph selector rather than a ledger selector is what
  that would take, and it is its own decision — the page would have to offer the graphs a
  capability can read (`urn:iki:store:graphs` answers exactly that) rather than the ledgers.
- **No refusal for a graph outside the set.** `GRAPH <other>` inside a scoped read matches
  nothing rather than erroring, so a query naming a graph the `graph=` argument left out is
  answered, emptily. `ikigai-store` reports it; nothing here can see it.
- **No archived explanation without a net grant.** `urn:repo:{root}:explain` is ONE action
  whether it derives or serves an entry the archive already holds, so the `urn:cap:net:*` it
  declares is required either way. `version=` provably derives nothing (`ikigai-browse`
  answers `NotFound` on a miss rather than falling back to a model), so through that ROW there
  is still no way to grant "may read what was already paid for" without also granting "may
  spend". ★ Since the graph decision there is a way around it that is not a hole:
  `--browse-graph read` reads the archive as QUADS through `urn:iki:store:graph-select`, with
  no net grant — the text without the spending. It is not the browse face (no rendering, no
  `version=` resolution, no file), so the grain the HTTP browse face has to answer is
  narrower than it was, not gone.
- **No explanation archive to start from, and no sync with one.** A gonk with browse roots
  configured begins with an empty browse graph and pays in inference for the first explanation
  of everything. An archive another host already derived over the same directories can be
  CARRIED in — see *Importing an archive from another host's store* — but that import is a
  one-shot: it is an operator running a tool with the server stopped, not a subscription.
  Anything the source derives afterwards stays there until the import is run again, and
  nothing here notices the difference. ⚠ Two hosts serving the same roots from two archives
  therefore DIVERGE silently, which is an argument for retiring the source rather than
  running both.
- **No rate limit on derivation.** The bounds on spending are the per-call `max_tokens`
  ceilings, the archive (once per content version, reused forever), and who holds a net
  grant. Nothing counts calls or spend over time; `ikigai-throttle`'s `RateLimit` overlay is
  the shape that would, and it is not linked.
- **No trace across the mount for a first call.** The tracer is forwarded to the peer only
  when it is already connected, because `set_tracer` is called on the resolve path and
  dialling from there would turn `trace` into a connect attempt.
- **Coarse browse invalidation.** One golden thread per ROOT: any change under a root
  recomputes every cached read of it. A per-file thread would have to be built from the file's
  own IRI, and the percent-encoding that produces it is private to `ikigai-browse`; a thread
  computed one way at the read and another way at the cut is worse than invalidating too much.
- **Backups sit on the disk they protect.** Off-machine is a separate decision and has not
  been made. `urn:iki:gonk:backup:archive:{name}` is what makes one copyable through the
  socket without linking a filesystem family into the process that holds the dataset, so the
  mechanism exists and the policy does not.
- **No encryption at rest.** An archive is mode `0600` and is the whole dataset in one file —
  every graph the per-graph capabilities exist to separate.
  [`ikigai-encrypt`](https://github.com/ikigai-rs/ikigai-encrypt) is the shape that would fix
  it and is not linked.
- **A backup is whole, never incremental.** Five rotations of the whole dataset, on a store
  measured in megabytes. Nothing here would scale to a store measured in gigabytes: the dump
  is materialized in memory and ordered, which is what buys byte-identical archives.
- **No RocksDB checkpoint.** The fast, engine-coupled snapshot (hard links, consistent,
  opaque) is the right tool before a risky migration and is not built; the portable RDF
  archive is the one that still works when the engine has moved or the store will not open.
- **A restore does not adopt.** It builds a store beside the live one and tells you what it
  verified; swapping it in is manual, with the server stopped.
- **No browse face on the HTTP door.** The family is reachable through the socket and QUIC
  doors and by SPARQL; the browser face still serves ledgers only, and no route maps to
  `urn:repo:*`.
