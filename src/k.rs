//! The host's `/k/` adapter, and the shell the browse family's HTML faces render inside.
//!
//! ```text
//! /k?c=source {iri} [k=v …]   urn:iki:gonk:k                    Source  one read, the caller's cap
//! /k?c=sink {iri} [k=v …]     urn:iki:gonk:k                    Sink    the annotation family only
//! /browse/{iri}               urn:iki:gonk:page:browse:{iri}    Source  the page those faces live in
//! /browse                     urn:iki:gonk:page:browse          Source  the roots this caller may read
//! ```
//!
//! # ★ The buttons already exist; this is the door they were missing
//!
//! Nothing here renders a browse affordance. `ikigai-browse` does: every one of its HTML
//! faces emits `hx-get="/k/source {iri} [k=v …]"` for a read and
//! `hx-post="/k/sink urn:iki:annotation"` for a write, and it calls that "the HOST's `/k/`
//! adapter". Explain, Explain With, the crumbs, the PR family and (when a released browse
//! carries it) Review are all that one shape. **So this module knows verbs and IRIs and
//! nothing about buttons** — a face that grows a new affordance tomorrow works here the day
//! gonk's pin moves, and a door that recognized "the explain button" would have to be
//! edited for each one.
//!
//! # ⚠ The one difference from the same adapter at `ikigai-web`'s port, and why it exists
//!
//! `ikigai-web` the standalone server parses the raw request-target itself, so
//! `GET /k/source urn:repo:x:file:src/lib.rs as=text/html` reaches its `k_command` intact.
//! gonk's door is a different program: the `ikigai-web` LIBRARY, which percent-decodes the
//! path and then rebuilds an IRI from it — through a route template, or by the mechanical
//! `/a/b/c` → `urn:a:b:c` join. **A command cannot survive either**, for two independent
//! reasons measured against the live server on 2026-09-19:
//!
//! - the command carries SPACES, and a space is not legal in an IRI, so the rebuilt target
//!   fails `Iri::parse` and the library answers `400 not a resource path` before any gonk
//!   code runs — `GET /k/source%20urn:repo:ikigai-core:file:README.md%20as=text/html` at
//!   1060 was exactly that 400;
//! - browse's file IRIs carry SLASHES, and a route pattern's `{var}` captures exactly one
//!   path segment, so the path is not even one capture.
//!
//! Percent-encoding does not help: the library decodes before it templates, so `%20` is a
//! space by the time a route sees it. There is no host-side seam that takes a raw path.
//!
//! ★ So **the command travels as an ARGUMENT** — `/k?c=<command>` — which the library
//! carries verbatim (a query value is decoded per value, never split). The grammar INSIDE
//! `c` is browse's own, unchanged and unextended: `source|sink <iri> [k=v …]`, whitespace
//! separated. The path spelling browse emits is folded into that query form in the browser,
//! by `web/gonk.js`, on `htmx:configRequest` — the same file, the same trust domain and the
//! same failure mode as htmx itself, which is what issues every one of these requests. A
//! caller with no browser writes the query form directly.
//!
//! ⚠ **The real fix is one layer down** and is not gonk's to make: `ikigai-web`'s route
//! table has no trailing-segment capture and no raw-path seam, so no host of that library
//! can serve a command-shaped adapter. Reported to the hub rather than worked around twice.
//!
//! # Capability: the caller's, and nothing else
//!
//! Every request through this module is issued with [`Invocation::issue`], which carries the
//! CALLER's capability — [`crate::doors::http_cap`]'s per-request one. The adapter holds no
//! authority of its own and declares none: what a reader may read and whether a click may
//! spend inference is decided by the browse resources' own `requires`, one hop in.
//!
//! Three consequences worth naming, because each is a test in `tests/browse.rs`:
//!
//! - **an anonymous loopback caller cannot derive.** `gonk.http.ledger`'s anonymous grant is
//!   ledger tokens only; every browse row declares `urn:cap:browse:read:*` and every
//!   derivation also `urn:cap:net:*`, which gonk mints for nobody. The refusal is the
//!   kernel's typed `Denied`, before dispatch, naming the token;
//! - **a cross-site POST cannot annotate.** `/k?c=sink …` is a POST like any other, so it
//!   goes through the same [`crate::doors::http_scopes`] check that closed the first arc's
//!   hole: a foreign `Origin`/`Sec-Fetch-Site` (or a foreign `Host`, on any method) computes
//!   an EMPTY capability, and `urn:iki:annotation`'s Sink requires `urn:cap:annotate`;
//! - **a Sink reaches the annotation family and nothing else.** The same bound
//!   `ikigai-web`'s adapter draws, and the same one [`crate::web`]'s `Act` draws around the
//!   ledger: the adapter never widens a door's write surface. gonk serves only the
//!   `urn:iki:annotation` spelling — the manifest installs no alias for the older
//!   `urn:annotation` one, so neither does this.
//!
//! # The answer is the target's answer, whole
//!
//! A `source` returns the representation the resource produced — its bytes, its media type,
//! its cache validity and its golden threads — not a copy of the bytes in a fresh envelope.
//! That is what makes the adapter invisible: a cacheable read stays cacheable to the hub
//! that caches it, and a watcher's thread still cuts the entry the hub holds. It is also why
//! this resource declares no `outputs` and waives three of `ikigai-conformance`'s checks
//! (see `tests/conformance.rs`): its faces, its capability floor and its cache validity all
//! belong to whatever the command names, and are not knowable until it is read.
//!
//! # ⚠ What this door does NOT bound: what one click costs
//!
//! One HTTP request here is exactly one kernel request. That is the whole of the adapter's
//! economics, and it is deliberately all of it: a directory-grain explain fans out per child
//! INSIDE `ikigai-browse` (`explain.rs::derive_dir` sources each child's own explanation
//! recursively, bottoming out at files, with unchanged children as archive hits), so one
//! click on a directory can be many model calls, and none of that is visible from here. The
//! door must not multiply it either — nothing in the shell prefetches, and no face is
//! fetched that a person did not ask for. Counting spend over time is ledger #308 and is not
//! a thing a door can do.
