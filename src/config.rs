//! With no `gonk.browse.root` line this server composes exactly what it composed before: the
//! store and the ledgers. Each line adds `urn:repo:<name>:…` over that directory — and the
//! first one also binds `ikigai-repo`'s facades, which run `git` and `gh`. That is a real
//! widening of what is compiled in and reachable, so it is opt-in, per root, by path.
//!
//! **Flags override config wholesale**, the rule standalone `ikigai-web` set: `--port 9000`
//! against `gonk.bind = "127.0.0.1:1070"` serves loopback 9000, and a repeatable flag
//! replaces every line of its key rather than adding to them. A key under `gonk.` that this
//! server does not know is an error, not a no-op — a misspelled setting that silently did

ikigai-gonk — a standalone ikigai work-ledger server

usage:
  ikigai-gonk [serve] [flags]      hold the durable store and serve the ledgers
  ikigai-gonk client add <name> [--ledger <ledger>=<read|write|delete|purge>]... [--browse-graph <read|write>] [--cert <client.crt>] [--force]
                                   trust a QUIC client: mint its identity (or import the
                                   certificate it generated with --cert) into a bundle, and
                                   with --ledger enrol its fingerprint under a grant
  ikigai-gonk passkey invite <name> --ledger <ledger>=<read|write|delete|purge>... [--browse-graph <read|write>] [--minutes N] [--port N] [--config PATH] [--force]
                                   write grant <name> and print a one-time
                                   http://localhost:<port>/#invite=… link; the browser that
                                   opens it enrols a passkey under that grant
  ikigai-gonk review request <repo> <path> [--config PATH]
                                   drop ONE review request into the queue `gonk.review.space`
                                   names. Writes one file and exits: no store, no door, no
                                   network — so a git hook can call it per changed file and a
                                   commit never waits. Identical requests collapse to one
                                   tuple (the drop is content-addressed)
  ikigai-gonk grants <ledger> [read|write|delete|purge]
                                   print the capability tokens for one ledger (JSON)
  ikigai-gonk grants --browse-graph [read|write]
                                   print the tokens for the BROWSE graph — SPARQL access to
                                   annotations, archived explanations and review findings as
                                   quads, through urn:iki:store:graph-*. Not the browse
                                   endpoints: no file contents, no gh, and no deriving

serve flags (each overrides its config key wholesale):
  --bind IP:PORT        the HTTP door (config `gonk.bind`); loopback only — default 127.0.0.1:1060
  --port N              shorthand for --bind 127.0.0.1:N (config `gonk.port`)
  --socket PATH         the owner-only socket (config `gonk.socket`); default ~/.ikigai/gonk.sock
  --quic-bind IP:PORT   the QUIC door (config `gonk.quic.bind`); default 0.0.0.0:1060 (UDP).
                        Unset, the door opens once a client certificate is enrolled; set,
                        it must open, and gonk refuses to start when no client can be admitted
  --no-quic             do not open the QUIC door this run
  --http-ledger NAME    a ledger the HTTP door may read and write (repeatable; config
                        `gonk.http.ledger`); default `default`
  --browse-root N=PATH  serve urn:repo:N:* over PATH (repeatable; config `gonk.browse.root`).
                        Unset, the browse family and ikigai-repo's git/gh facades are not
                        bound at all; the socket door's root capability reaches both
  --mount SPEC          `prefer urn:llm:=<target> [cert-dir]` (repeatable; config
                        `gonk.mount`) — the peer that serves urn:llm:*, which is what binds
                        the explain and review families over the browse roots. Unset, they
                        are not bound at all: an action no kernel can satisfy is an
                        over-offer. Deriving one requires a net grant, which no grant this
                        server MINTS carries — see `grants` and the README
  --no-backup           take no SCHEDULED backup this run (config `gonk.backup.every =
                        \"off\"`). urn:iki:gonk:backup and urn:iki:gonk:restore stay bound:
