//! Backup and restore — the one export door this dataset has, and the only one it can
//! have.
//!
//! # Why this is a gonk capability and not an ops script
//!
//! RocksDB permits one writer per directory, so on a machine that runs gonk, gonk holds
//! `~/.ikigai/store` and nothing else may open it ([`crate::compose`]'s decision of record).
//! Two consequences, and together they decide the whole design:
//!
//! - **No second process can export the dataset.** There is no `ikigai -c 'source
//!   urn:iki:store:…'` that opens the files; there is only this process.
//! - **`cp -r` of the live directory is a torn snapshot.** SST files and the write-ahead
//!   log mutate under the copy, and the result may not open, or may open and be quietly
//!   short.
//!
//! So the export has to be a face this server offers, and it is [`BACKUP`].
//!
//! # ⚠ The format is N-Quads, and the easy mistake is Turtle
//!
//! **CONSTRUCT returns TRIPLES.** This dataset is partitioned by named graph — a graph per
//! named ledger, its graveyard beside it, `ikigai-browse`'s own graphs, the reserved set —
//! and that partition is what every per-graph capability
//! ([`crate::grants`]) is written against. A backup serialized as Turtle or N-Triples
//! collapses every graph into one: the quad count still matches, every triple round-trips,
//! and the restored dataset has every tenant's statements in the default graph with the
//! tenancy boundary gone. Nothing in a count would tell you.
//!
//! Measured 2026-09-16 on this machine: one named graph,
//! `urn:iki:ledger:graph:default`, holding all 2850 quads, and a default graph holding
//! zero — so today's data would survive a Turtle dump by luck. The format does not depend
//! on today's data shape.
//!
//! # ★ The dump is the engine's own words in both directions
//!
//! A backup is `urn:iki:store:select` over `{ GRAPH ?g { ?s ?p ?o } } UNION { ?s ?p ?o }`,
//! read back with **oxigraph's own SPARQL-results parser** and written with **oxigraph's
//! own N-Quads serializer**. Neither end is string surgery. That matters more than it
//! looks: this dataset holds ledger item bodies with newlines, quotation marks and
//! trailing periods in them, and a hand-rolled `?s ?p ?o .` writer corrupts exactly those
//! rows — in the one file nobody reads until the day they need it.
//!
//! `ORDER BY ?g ?s ?p ?o` is on the query on purpose. `urn:compress:gzip` pins its header
//! fields, so identical bytes compress to identical archives; a stable row order is the
//! other half of making "the data has not changed since the last backup" a digest
//! comparison rather than a belief. The cost is that the whole result is sorted — which is
//! fine at this dataset's scale (megabytes) and is the first thing to revisit if it is not.
//!
//! # Capability posture — the two most dangerous grants in the system
//!
//! - **A backup reads EVERY graph**, which is exactly the authority the per-graph boundary
//!   exists to avoid handing out. [`BACKUP`] therefore declares `urn:cap:store:read` (the
//!   broad token) *and* [`CAP_BACKUP`], which names the second authority it exercises and
//!   `urn:cap:store:read` does not: writing into and pruning gonk's backup directory.
//! - **A restore writes EVERY graph.** [`RESTORE`] declares [`CAP_RESTORE`].
//! - **Neither is reachable from the HTTP door, and that is structural rather than
//!   careful.** The HTTP door's capability is exactly the per-ledger token list
//!   [`crate::grants::grants_for_all`] computes, plus a signed-in passkey's grant; none of
//!   those lists can contain any of these three tokens, because
//!   [`crate::quic::check_grants`] refuses a `grants.json` that names one. So the
//!   privileged half of this feature lives behind the owner-only socket — its own door, not
//!   a flag on the public one — and `tests/doors.rs` proves the public door still cannot
//!   reach even `urn:iki:store:info`.
//!
//! # A backup you have not restored is not a backup
//!
//! [`RESTORE`] is the verifier as well as the restore path. It loads an archive into a
//! **new** store directory and compares the graph set and the per-graph quad counts of the
//! restored dataset against the archive it was built from — not just a total, because a
//! total is exactly the number the Turtle trap preserves. `tests/backup.rs` runs it against
//! the real stopgap archive the hub took before this feature existed.
//!
//! # A merge is not a restore
//!
//! Loading a backup into a non-empty store yields a UNION: deleted items come back, and the
//! result can never be the state that was backed up. So [`RESTORE`] **refuses** a target
//! that already holds quads, and refuses the live store outright. What it produces is a
//! complete store directory beside the live one; swapping them is an operator's act, with
//! the server stopped, which is the one moment when the destructive step is visible.
//!
//! # ★ The schedule is untrustworthy without [`STATUS`]
//!
//! gonk sits inside the accepted heartbeat-coverage gap, and a scheduled job that HANGS
//! reads STALE forever and never reads FAILING. At a 24-hour cadence a wedged backup is
//! invisible for a day at best and permanently at worst. [`STATUS`] is what makes the
//! schedule worth having: it answers from BOTH sides — the newest archive actually on disk
//! with its counts and digests, and the live timer's own health (`runs`, time since the
//! last run, time since the last SUCCESS, failures in a row). A job that has not fired
//! shows as a growing `since_last`; a job that fires and fails shows as
//! `failures_in_a_row`. Neither reads as "fine".
